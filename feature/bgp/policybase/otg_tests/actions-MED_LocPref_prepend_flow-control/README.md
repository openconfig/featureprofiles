## Testbed type

## Procedure
### Applying configuration

For each section of configuration below, prepare a gnmi.SetBatch  with all the configuration items appended to one SetBatch.  Then apply the configuration to the DUT in one gnmi.Set using the `replace` option.
> WARNING: Replace operations should be performed at an appropriate level in the config tree to ensure that preexisting configuration objects necessary for DUT management access and base operation are not removed.

#### Initial Setup:

*   Connect DUT port-1, 2 to ATE port-1, 2
*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on the ports
*   Create an IPv4 networks i.e. ```ipv4-network-1 = 192.168.10.0/24``` attached to ATE port-1
*   Create an IPv6 networks i.e. ```ipv6-network-1 = 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` attached to ATE port-1
*   Create an IPv4 networks i.e. ```ipv4-network-2 = 192.168.20.0/24``` attached to ATE port-2
*   Create an IPv6 networks i.e. ```ipv6-network-2 = 2024:db8:64:64::/64``` attached to ATE port-2
*   Configure IPv4 and IPv6 iBGP between DUT Port-1 and ATE Port-1
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/config
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/afi-safi/config/
    *   Advertise ```ipv4-network-1 = 192.168.10.0/24``` and ```ipv6-network-1 = 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` from ATE to DUT over the IPv4 and IPv6 eBGP session on port-1 with:
        * MED = 50
        * Local Preference = 50
*   Configure IPv4 and IPv6 eBGP between DUT Port-2 and ATE Port-2
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/config
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/afi-safi/config/
    *   Advertise ```ipv4-network-2 = 192.168.20.0/24``` and ```ipv6-network-2 = 2024:db8:64:64::/64``` from ATE to DUT over the IPv4 and IPv6 eBGP session on port-2.  The ATE should advertise both prefixes with:
        * MED = 50
        * Local Preference = 50
