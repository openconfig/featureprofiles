# RT-2.4: BGP Policy AS Path Set and Community Set

## Summary

BGP policy configuration for AS Paths and Community Sets

## Procedure

* RT-2.4.1 - Test setup
  * Generate config for 2 DUT ports, with DUT port 1 eBGP session to ATE port 1.

  * Generate config for ATE 2 ports, with ATE port 1 eBGP session to DUT port 1.

  * Configure ATE port 1 to advertise ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes using the following aspaths and communities:
    * prefix-set-1 with as path `[100, 200, 300]` and communities `[100:1, 200:2, 300:3]`
    * prefix-set-2 with as path `[100, 400, 300]` and communities `[101:1]`
    * prefix-set-3 with as path `[109]` and communities `[109:1]`
    * prefix-set-4 with as path `[200]` and communities `[200:1]`
    * prefix-set-5 with as path `[300]` and communities `[100:1]`

  * Establish eBGP sessions between ATE port-1 and DUT port-1
  * Generate traffic from ATE port-2 to all prefixes
  * Validate that traffic is received on ATE port-1 for all prefixes

* RT-2.4.1 - Validate single routing-policy containing as-path-set and ext-community-set

  * Create a as-path-set named `any_my_regex_aspath` with members
    * `{ as-path-set-member = [ "(10[0-9]]|200)" ] }`
  * Create a community-set named `any_my_regex_comms` with members and match options as follows:
    * `{ community-member = [ "10[0-9]:1" ] }`

  * Create a `policy-definition` named 'path_and_community' with the following `statements`
    * statement[name='match_community']/
      * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/community-set = 'any_my_regex_comms'
      * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/match-set-options = ANY
      * actions/config/policy-result = ACCEPT_ROUTE
    * statement[name='match_as']/
      * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-as-path-set/config/as-path-set = 'any_my_regex_aspath'
      * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-as-path-set/config/match-set-options = ANY
      * actions/config/policy-result = ACCEPT_ROUTE

  * Send traffic
    * Verify traffic is forwarded for routes with matching policy
    * Verify traffic is not forwarded for routes without matching policy

### Expected prefix matches

| prefix-set   | path_and_community |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| prefix-set-1 | accept             |
| prefix-set-2 | accept             |
| prefix-set-3 | accept             |
| prefix-set-4 | reject             |
| prefix-set-5 | reject             |
