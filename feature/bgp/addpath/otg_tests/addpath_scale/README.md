# RT-1.15: BGP Addpath on scale with and without routing policy

## Summary

BGP add-paths test with scale and routing-policy

## Testbed type

* [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_4.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_4.testbed)
* ATE port1 - Used for traffic source
* ATE port2, port3 - Used to advertise routes to the DUT
* ATE port4 - Used for verification of Add-path send or receive capabilities.

## Topology

```mermaid
graph LR;
A[ATE PORT1] <-- IPv4-IPv6 --> B[DUT PORT1];
C[ATE:PORT2] <-- 100 eBGP Peers--> D[DUT PORT2 VLAN1 to VLAN 100];
E[ATE:PORT3] <-- 50 eBGP Peers--> F[DUT PORT2 VLAN201 to VLAN 250];
G[ATE:PORT4] <-- eBGP --> H[PORT4:DUT];
```

## Procedure

### Testbed setup - Generate configuration for ATE and DUT

#### Source port for sending traffic

* DUT Port1 --- IP Connectivity --- ATE Port1
* Use this port to configure traffic with following source and destination
  prefixes
    - source (IPv4/IPv6) - 200.0.0.0/24 and 1000::200.0.0.0/126 respectively.
    - destination (IPv4/IPv6) - All prefixes of ATE port2, port3

Establish eBGP sessions ipv4 and ipv6 for ATE/DUT port2,3:
#### 100 v4EBGP peers
ATE port2 <---> DUT port2

* Create 100 vlans on DUT and ATE port2 and configure IP addresses as below and
  advertise 1.48M ipv4 routes from the ATE.
    * Configure each of the vlan subinterface using these IPv4 address
      50.1.1.0/24 (vlan1), 50.1.2.0/24 (vlan2), 50.1.3.0/24 (vlan3),
      50.1.4.0/24 (vlan4) ...... 50.1.100.0/24 (vlan101)
    * Configure eBGP peers on each of the interfaces and advertise 14.8k routes
      from each of this ATE eBGP neighbor such that the routes are from
      172.20.0.0 block from each of this eBGP peers which would be used as
      addpath routes such that the routes are distributed across /22[5], /24[25], /30[70]
      prefix lengths.

#### 50 v6EBGP peers
ATE port3 <---> DUT port3

* Create 50 vlans on DUT and ATE port2 and configure IP addresses as below and
  advertise 120k ipv6 routes from ATE
    * Configure each of the vlan subinterface using these IPv6 address
      1000::50:1:1:0/64 (vlan201), 1000::50:1:2:0/64 (vlan202),
      1000::50:1:3:0/64 (vlan203), 1000::50:1:4:0/64 (vlan204) ....
      1000::50:1:50:0/64 (vlan250) - A total of 50 subinterfaces and ipv6 address
    * Configure eBGP peers on each of the interfaces and advertise 2.4k routes
      from each of this ATE eBGP neighbor such that the routes are from
      2002:a00:: block from each of this eBGP peers which would be used as
      addpath routes such that the routes are distributed across /48 , /64, /126
      prefix lengths

#### 1 v4EBGP and 1 v6EBGP peers
ATE port4 (AS 65401) <---> DUT port4 (AS 65001)

* Configure the DUT and ATE port with ipv4 and ipv6 address 200.0.0.0/24 and
  1000::200:0:0:0/126 respectively
* This eBGP neighbor is used to verify the routes advertised by the DUT and then
  making sure if addpath send and send-max is enabled.

#### Prefix definition and communities definition
ipv4-prefix1 = prefixes of length /22 - Communities `[100:1, 200:1]`
ipv4-prefix2 = prefixes of length /24 - Communities `[101:1, 201:1]`
ipv4-prefix3 = prefixes of length /30 - Communities `[104:1, 109:3]`

ipv6-prefix1 = prefixes of length /48 - Communities `[100:1, 200:1]`
ipv6-prefix2 = prefixes of length /64 - Communities `[101:1, 201:1]`
ipv6-prefix3 = prefixes of length /126 - Communities `[104:1, 109:3]`

#### Canonical OC for DUT configuration

This section should contain a JSON formatted stanza representing the
canonical OC to configure BGP add-paths. (See the
[README Template](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/doc/test-requirements-template.md#procedure))

### RT-1.15.1: Add-Path (Initial State with add-path send & receive disabled):

*   Verification (Telemetry):
    *   Verify that all 1.48M and 120k routes advertised from ATE ports are
        learnt by DUT and only the best route is installed in the RIB which
        would mean there is only one best path out of 100 paths for ipv4 and 50
        paths for ipv6
    *   Verify that the DUT's telemetry output reflects the enabled Add-Path
        capabilities with send and receive in disabled state

### RT-1.15.2: Add-Path (With add-path receive only enabled on DUT):

*   Enable Add-Path receive only for all the IPv4 & IPv6 eBGP neighbors and
    advertise all the 1.48M ipv4 and 120k ipv6 routes from the ATE.
    /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/

*   Verification (Telemetry):
    *   Verify that all 1.48M and 120k routes advertised from ATE ports are
        learnt by DUT and the RIB should show up all the 100 paths for ipv4 and
        50 paths for ipv6 routes. However the FIB would have only the best
        route installed
    *   Verify that the DUT's telemetry output reflects the enabled Add-Path
        capabilities with send in disabled state and receive in enabled state
        /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/

        /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/
        afi-safi/add-paths/state/send
    *   Verify that ATE port-4 receives the routes advertised from DUT and
        only add-path receive capabilities enabled and there is just one path
    *   Verify that the DUT forwards traffic only on the best path with 100%
        which is on vlan1 for ipv4 traffic and vlan201 for ipv6 traffic
        so other vlans should see 100% loss.

### RT-1.15.3: Add-Path (With add-path send, receive, send-max enabled on DUT):

*   Enable Add-Path send and receive only for all the IPv4 & IPv6 eBGP neighbors
    and advertise all the 1.48M ipv4 and 120k ipv6 routes from the ATE.

        50 paths for ipv6 routes. However the FIB would have only the best
        route installed.
    *   Verify that the DUT's telemetry output reflects the enabled Add-Path

        /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/
        afi-safi/add-paths/state/send-max:
    *   Verify that ATE port-4 receives the routes advertised from DUT and
        both add-path send & receive capabilities are enabled with multiple
        paths for ipv4, ipv6 routes.
    *   Verify that the DUT forwards traffic only on the best path with 100%
        which is on vlan1 for ipv4 traffic and vlan201 for ipv6 traffic
        so other vlans should see 100% loss.

### RT-1.15.4: Route churn and verify Add-path telemetry

*   Do BGP route flap from the ATE ports a few times like maybe 120 seconds and
    wait for sometime for the route churn to settle down.
*   Verification: Telemetry
    *   Repeat verification steps in RT-1.15.3

### RT-1.16.1 BGP add-paths scale with routing-policy

* Re-advertise the routes with communities which is defined in the
  section prefix-definition and communities
* Configure the following community sets on the DUT.
    * Create a community-set named `any_my_3_comms` with members as follows:
        * `{ community-member = [ "100:1", "200:1", "201:1" ] }`
    * Create a community-set named `all_3_comms` with members and match options as follows:
        * `{ community-member = [ "100:1", "104:1", "201:1" ] }`
    * Create a community-set named `any_my_regex_comms` with members and match options as follows:
        * `{ community-member = [ "10[0-9]:1" ] }`
* Create a `policy-definition` named 'community-match' with the following `statements`
    * statement[name='accept_any_3_comms']/
        * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/community-set = 'any_my_3_comms'
        * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/match-set-options = ANY
        * actions/config/policy-result = ACCEPT_ROUTE
    * statement[name='accept_all_3_comms']/
        * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/community-set = 'all_3_comms'
        * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/match-set-options = ALL
        * actions/config/policy-result = ACCEPT_ROUTE
    * statement[name='accept_any_my_regex_comms']/
        * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/community-set = 'any_my_regex_comms'
        * conditions/bgp-conditions/match-community-set/config/match-set-options = ANY
        * actions/config/policy-result = ACCEPT_ROUTE

*   Verification (Telemetry):
* Send traffic from ATE port-2 to all prefix-sets.
    * Verify traffic is received on ATE port 1 for accepted prefixes.
