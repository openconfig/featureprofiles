# RT-1.27: Static route to BGP redistribution

## Summary

- Static routes selected for redistribution base on combination of: prefix-set, set-tag
- MED set to value of metric of static route (metric propagation)
- AS-Path prepend to contain AS with value provided in configuration (repeat prepend 'n' times)
- Local-Preference to a value provided in configuration
- Community list set to defined community set
- BGP protocol next-hop set to value provided in configuration
- Redstribute static-route with "DROP" as the next-hop

## Procedure

#### Initial Setup:

*   Connect DUT port-1, 2 and 3 to ATE port-1, 2 and 3 respectively

*   Configure IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on DUT and ATE ports as shown below
    *   DUT port-1 IPv4 address ```dp1-v4 = 192.168.1.1/30```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv4 address ```ap1-v4 = 192.168.1.2/30```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv4 address ```dp2-v4 = 192.168.1.5/30```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv4 address ```ap2-v4 = 192.168.1.6/30```

    *   DUT port-3 IPv4 address ```dp3-v4 = 192.168.1.9/30```
    *   ATE port-3 IPv4 address ```ap3-v4 = 192.168.1.10/30```

    *   DUT port-1 IPv6 address ```dp1-v6 = 2001:DB8::1/126```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv6 address ```ap1-v6 = 2001:DB8::2/126```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv6 address ```dp2-v6 = 2001:DB8::5/126```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv6 address ```ap2-v6 = 2001:DB8::6/126```

    *   DUT port-3 IPv6 address ```dp3-v6 = 2001:DB8::9/126```
    *   ATE port-3 IPv6 address ```ap3-v6 = 2001:DB8::10/126```

*   Create two IPv4 networks i.e. ```ipv4-network = 192.168.10.0/24``` and ```ipv4-drop-network = 192.168.20.0/24``` attached to ATE port-2

*   Create two IPv6 networks i.e. ```ipv6-network = 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` and ```ipv6-drop-network = 2024:db8:64:64::/64``` attached to ATE port-2

    *   Do not configure BGP between DUT port-2 and ATE port-2
    *   Do not advertise ```ipv4-network 192.168.10.0/24``` or ```ipv6-network 2024:db8:128:128::/64```

*   Configure an IPv4 static route ```ipv4-route``` on DUT destined to the ```ipv4-network``` i.e. ```192.168.10.0/24``` with the next hop set to the IPv4 address of ATE port-2 ```ap2-v4``` i.e. ```192.168.1.6/30```
