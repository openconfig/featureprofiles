## Summary

- Source-protocol: BGP, destination-protocol: ISIS L2
- Using Community (Source-protocol: BGP)
- Using defined prefix set

## Testbed type

*   https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_4.testbed

## Procedure

#### Initial Setup:

*   Connect DUT port-1, 2 to ATE port-1, 2
*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on the ports
*   Create an IPv4 networks i.e. ```ipv4-network = 192.168.10.0/24``` attached to ATE port-2
*   Create an IPv6 networks i.e. ```ipv6-network = 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` attached to ATE port-2
*   Configure IPv4 and IPv6 eBGP between DUT Port-2 and ATE Port-2
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/config
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/afi-safi/config/
    *   Advertise ```ipv4-network = 192.168.10.0/24``` and ```ipv6-network = 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` from ATE to DUT with community ```64512:100```
*   Configure IPv4 and IPv6 IS-IS L2 adjacency between ATE port-1 and DUT port-1
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/isis/global/afi-safi
    *   Set level-capability to ```LEVEL_2```
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/isis/global/config/level-capability
    *   Set metric-style to ```WIDE_METRIC```
