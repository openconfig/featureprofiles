# RT-1.51: BGP multipath ECMP

## Summary

Validate BGP in multipath scenario

## Testbed type

[TESTBED_DUT_ATE_4LINKS](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_4.testbed)

## Procedure

### Setup

*   Connect DUT port 1, 2, 3 and 4 to ATE port 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively
*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on the interfaces
*   Establish eBGP sessions between:
    *   ATE port-1 and DUT port-1
    *   ATE port-2 and DUT port-2
    *   ATE port-3 and DUT port-3
    *   ATE port-4 and DUT port-4
*   Enable an Accept-route all import-policy/export-policy for eBGP session
    under the neighbor AFI/SAFI
*   Create an IPv4 internal target network attached to ATE port 2, 3 and 4

### Tests

*   RT-1.51.1: Verify best path

    *   Configure ATE devices(ports) on same AS
    *   Advertise equal cost paths from 3 interfaces of ATE of same AS
    *   Check entries in FIB for advertised prefix, it should only have 1 entry
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/afts/next-hop-groups/next-hop-group/next-hops
    *   Initiate traffic from ATE port-1 to the DUT and destined to internal
        target network
    *   Check entire traffic should only be forwarded by one of DUT port2, port3
        or port4

*   RT-1.51.2: Enforcing multipath hence ECMP scope to only one peer AS

    *   Configure ATE devices(ports) on same AS
    *   Enable multipath and set maximum-paths limit to 2
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/peer-groups/peer-group/afi-safis/afi-safi/use-multiple-paths/config/enabled
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/afi-safi/use-multiple-paths/ebgp/config/maximum-paths
    *   Advertise equal cost paths from 3 interfaces of ATE of same AS
    *   Check entries in FIB for advertised prefix, it should only have 2
        entries
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/afts/next-hop-groups/next-hop-group/next-hops
    *   Initiate traffic from ATE port-1 to the DUT and destined to internal
        target network
    *   Check entire traffic should only be equally forwarded by any two among DUT
        port2, port3 or port4

*   RT-1.51.3: Verify use of allow-multiple-as for ECMP routing across different
    peer AS

    *   Configure ATE devices(ports) on different AS
    *   Enable multipath, set maximum-paths limit to 2 and enable allow multiple
        AS
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/peer-groups/peer-group/afi-safis/afi-safi/use-multiple-paths/config/enabled
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/afi-safi/use-multiple-paths/ebgp/config/allow-multiple-as
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/afi-safis/afi-safi/use-multiple-paths/ebgp/config/maximum-paths
    *   Advertise equal cost paths from 3 interfaces of ATE of different AS
    *   Check entries in FIB for advertised prefix, it should only have 2
        entries
        *   /network-instances/network-instance/afts/next-hop-groups/next-hop-group/next-hops
    *   Initiate traffic from ATE port-1 to the DUT and destined to internal
        target network
    *   Check entire traffic should only be equally forwarded by any two among DUT
        port2, port3 or port4
