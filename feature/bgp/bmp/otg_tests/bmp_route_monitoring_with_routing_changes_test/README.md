## Summary

Validate BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) correctly reports BGP route advertisements, withdrawals, and attribute changes in real-time. 

## Testbed type

*  [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_2.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed)

## Procedure 

### Configuration

1) Create the topology below:

```mermaid
graph LR; 
A[ATE:Port1] --EBGP--> B[Port1:DUT:Port2];
B --EBGP--> C[Port2:ATE];
```

2)   Establish Topology: Set up the physical connections as described in the topology diagram.

*   Connect ATE Port 1 to DUT Port 1.
*   Connect ATE Port 2 to DUT Port 2 (simulating the BMP monitoring station).

3) Interface Configuration: Configure IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on all involved interfaces on both the ATE and the DUT.

4) Establish eBGP Session: Configure and establish two external BGP (eBGP) peering sessions between the IP addresses of ATE Port 1 and DUT Port 1: one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.

5) Configure Global BMP on DUT: Configure the global BMP parameters on the DUT:
*   Enable BMP:

        /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/config/enabled

     *  Set to true.

*   Connection Mode (Active):

        /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/config/connection-mode
        
     *  Set to active.

*    Local Address:

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/config/local-address

      * Set to 172.16.1.1.

*    Statistics Timeout:

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/config/statistics-timeout

        Set to 60.

6)   Configure BMP Station on DUT: Configure the BMP monitoring station parameters on the DUT:

*    Station Name (e.g., bmp-station-1):

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/stations/station[name=bmp-station-1]/config/name
        * Set to bmp-station-1.
*    Station Address:

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/stations/station[name=bmp-station-1]/config/address

        * Set to 10.23.15.58.
*    Station Port:

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/stations/station[name=bmp-station-1]/config/port
        * Set to 7039.
*   Policy Type (Post-Policy Route Monitoring):

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/stations/station[name=bmp-station-1]/config/policy-type

       *  Set to POST_POLICY.

*   Exclude Non-Eligible Routes:

                /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/global/bmp/stations/station[name=bmp-station-1]/config/exclude-non-eligible

      *  Set to true.

### BMP-1.2.6: Verify policy filtering impact on monitoring

1)  Configure Import Policy: On the DUT, configure an import routing policy that applies to routes received from ATE Port 1 and modifies attributes for routes matching the prefix 192.0.2.0/24 and 2001:db8:4::/48:
        • Set local preference to 300 
        • Add community 65000:300 
2)  Advertise Prefix: Configure ATE Port 1 to advertise the prefix 192.0.2.0/24 and 2001:db8:4::/48

3)  Withdraw All Prefixes: Configure ATE Port 1 to simultaneously withdraw all three prefixes.
4)  Validate Multiple Withdrawals: Confirm that the BMP monitoring station receives separate BMP Route Monitoring messages for the withdrawal of each prefix, each containing the correct NLRI and indicating a withdrawal. Verify the sequence of messages if there's an expectation.

### BMP-1.2.8: Verify multiple prefix updates monitoring for IPv6

1)  Advertise Multiple Prefixes: Configure ATE Port 1 to simultaneously advertise the IPv6 prefixes 2001:db8:5::/48, 2001:db8:6::/48, and 2001:db8:7::/48.
2)  Validate Multiple Advertisements: Confirm that the BMP monitoring station receives separate BMP Route Monitoring messages for each of the advertised prefixes, each containing the correct NLRI and associated attributes.
3)  Withdraw All Prefixes: Configure ATE Port 1 to simultaneously withdraw all three prefixes.
4)  Validate Multiple Withdrawals: Confirm that the BMP monitoring station receives separate BMP Route Monitoring messages for the withdrawal of each prefix, each containing the correct NLRI and indicating a withdrawal. Verify the sequence of messages if there's an expectation.

### BMP-1.2.9: Verify route refresh impact on monitoring 

1)  Enable Route Refresh: Ensure that the BGP session between ATE Port 1 and DUT Port 1 has the route refresh capability negotiated.
2)  Advertise Prefixes: Configure ATE Port 1 to advertise several prefixes to the DUT. 
3)  Initiate Route Refresh: Configure the DUT to send a BGP Route Refresh request to ATE Port 1.
4)  Validate BMP Messages After Refresh: Confirm that the subsequent BMP Route Monitoring messages sent by the DUT to the monitoring station contain the correct attributes and any relevant flags associated with routes sent due to the route refresh.

### BMP-1.2.10: Verify BGP flap monitoring 

1)  Advertise Prefix: Configure ATE Port 1 to advertise the prefix 203.0.113.0/24 and 2001:db8:8::/48.
2)  Flap both BGP Sessions: Simulate a BGP sessions flap by tearing down and immediately re-establishing the BGP peerings between ATE Port 1 and DUT Port 1.
3)  Validate Withdrawal and Re-advertisement: Confirm that the BMP monitoring station receives a BMP Route Monitoring message indicating the withdrawal of 203.0.113.0/24 and 2001:db8:8::/48 due to the sessions down event, followed by a BMP Route Monitoring message indicating the re-advertisement of the same prefix once the session is re-established.
