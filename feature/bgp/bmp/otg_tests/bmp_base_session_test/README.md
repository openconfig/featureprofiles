# BMP-1.1: BMP Session Establishment and Telemetry Test

## Summary

Validate BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) session establishment and telemetry functionality with specific configuration parameters.
This BMP test is for post policy routes.

## Testbed type

*  [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_2.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed)

## Procedure 

### Configuration

1)  Create the topology below:


```mermaid
graph LR; 
A[ATE:Port1] --EBGP--> B[Port1:DUT:Port2];
B --EBGP--> C[Port2:ATE];
```


2)   Establish Topology: Set up the physical connections as described in the topology diagram.

*   Connect ATE Port 1 to DUT Port 1.
*   Connect ATE Port 2 to DUT Port 2 (simulating the BMP monitoring station).
*   Connected interface IPv4/IPv6 addresses

3) Interface Configuration: Configure IPv4 and IPV6 addresses on all involved interfaces on both the ATE and the DUT.

4) Establish eBGP Session: Configure and establish an external BGP (eBGP) peering session between the IP addresses of ATE Port 1 and DUT Port 1. Configure AS 64520 on the DUT and ATE port2 i.e. BMP station, configure AS 64530 on the ATE port1.
5) Establish eBGP session between ATE port-1 (AS 64530) and DUT port-1 (AS 64520)
6) Configure BMP on the DUT with the following parameters:

    • statistics-timeout: 60 seconds
    • connection-mode: active
    • local-address: 172.16.1.1
    • station-address: 10.23.15.58
    • station-port: 7039
    • route-monitoring: post-policy
    • exclude-noneligible: true

7) Advertise 10000 * IPV4 routes from the IP address range of 192.168.0.0 and 10.200.0.0
8) Should be RFC7854 compliant


### Tests

### BMP-1.1.1: Verify BMP session establishment

1)  Configure BMP station on ATE port-2 with address 10.23.15.58 and port 7039
2)  Verify that the DUT initiates a BMP session to the station (connection-mode: active), following this path:
3)  Confirm the connection is established using the configured local-address (172.16.1.1), following this path:
4)  Validate that the DUT connects to the correct station-address (10.23.15.58) and port (7039), following those paths:
5)  Check the session-state telemetry path to confirm the session is established


### BMP-1.1.2: Verify statistics reporting

1)  Verify that the DUT sends statistics reports at the configured interval (60 seconds), using path:
2)  Confirm that multiple consecutive reports are sent at the expected intervals, using path:

### BMP-1.1.3: Verify route monitoring with post-policy and exclude-noneligible

1)  Configure an import policy on the DUT to reject prefixes matching 172.16.0.0/16 and 2001:DB8::/32
2)  Have ATE port-1 advertise prefixes 192.0.2.0/24 and 172.16.0.0/16 for IPv4 and 2001:DB8:1::/48 and 2001:DB8::/32 for IPv6 to the DUT
3)  Verify that the BMP station receives route monitoring messages for 192.0.2.0/24  2001:DB8:1::/48, using those paths:
4)  Verify that the BMP station does not receive route monitoring messages for 172.16.0.0/16 and 2001:DB8::/32 (excluded by policy)
