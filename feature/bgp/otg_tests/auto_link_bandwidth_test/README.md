# **RT-7.51: BGP Auto-Generated Link-Bandwidth Community**


## **Summary**

These tests validate the functionality of the BGP auto-generated link-bandwidth extended community feature, which is configured using OpenConfig. The primary goal is to verify that the DUT correctly performs **Weighted Equal-Cost Multi-Path (wECMP)** forwarding based on the dynamic bandwidth of its BGP paths.

The tests ensure that a DUT correctly generates and attaches the link-bandwidth extended community to routes learned from eBGP peers. They also validate that separate IPv4 and IPv6 traffic flows are load-balanced across these BGP paths in direct proportion to the bandwidths indicated. The plan covers LAG dynamics, the hold-down timer, transitivity configuration, and precedence rules for both peer-advertised communities and local configuration hierarchy (neighbor vs. peer-group).


## **Testbed Topology**

**Testbed Type:**[ atedut5](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_5.testbed).

The test requires a single DUT with at least 5 ports connected to an ATE/OTG with at least 5 ports. The topology consists of one traffic-source ATE port and two sets of BGP peer links, each configured as a LAG.



*   `ATE Port 1 <--> DUT Port 1`: Used as the source for the test traffic.
*   `ATE Ports 2,3 <--> DUT Ports 2,3`: Forms `LAG-1` for the eBGP session with Peer 1.
*   `ATE Ports 4,5 <--> DUT Ports 4,5`: Forms `LAG-2` for the eBGP session with Peer 2.


## **RPCs and Protocols**



*   **gNMI:** Used for all configuration and telemetry operations.
*   **eBGP:** Used for advertising routes from ATE Peers 1 and 2 to the DUT.
*   **LACP: **Used for logically grouping physical links between DUT and Peers 1 and 2. 


## **Design & Implementation Details**

This feature enables wECMP by automatically attaching a BGP extended community to learned routes, with a value representing the **real-time bandwidth** of the ingress interface. The BGP decision process can then use this bandwidth value as a weight.

This test validates this functionality by creating a classic wECMP scenario:



1. ATE Peer 1 (on `LAG-1`) and ATE Peer 2 (on `LAG-2`) advertise the **same destination prefix** to the DUT, creating two paths.
2. The DUT, with `auto-link-bandwidth` enabled on the peer-group, attaches an LBW community to the routes learned from each peer.
3. ATE Source (on `Port 1`) sends traffic to the destination prefix.
4. The tests measure the traffic received by ATE Peer 1 and ATE Peer 2 to verify that the DUT load-balanced the traffic in proportion to the bandwidths specified in the LBW communities.

### **RT-7.51.6: Transitive Flag Configuration (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)**



*   **Objective:** Verify that the DUT correctly generates a non-transitive community when `transitive: false` is explicitly configured for both IPv4 and IPv6.
*   **Procedure Details:** This is a control-plane focused test.
