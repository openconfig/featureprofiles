# RT-1.35: BGP Graceful Restart Extended route retention (ExRR)

## Summary

This is an extension to the RFC8538 tests already conducted under "RT-1.4: BGP
Graceful Restart". However, ExRR is for projects that need to extend the validity
of a route beyond the expiration of the stale routes timer for the BGP GR
process. Following are the scenarios when ExRR can be considered by a project.

1.  Upon expiration of BGP hold-timer (Hold timer expiry on the Speaker side or
    when a notification for hold timer expiry is received from the helper)
2.  Upon the BGP session failing to re-establish within the GR restart timer as
    a helper.
3.  Upon multiple failures on the Speaker side resulting in GR restart timer or
    the stale path timer not to expire on the helper side.
4.  Upon expiration of the stale path timer Under the aforementioned conditions,
    the routes received from the neighbor under failure must be held for a
    configurable duration and processed through an additional configurable
    routing policy while being held in a “stale” state.

Since the route retention is purely local action of the receiving speaker, this
action should not require any additional capabilities advertisements beyond
capability 64 (Graceful Restart), and should not be confused with or require
capability 71 (Long-Lived Graceful Restart) from the sending speaker.

**How is this different from LLGR as tested in RT-1.14?**

As per the [IETF Draft on LLGR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-long-lived-gr),
we have the following that is different from EER.
*   Section 4.2 / 4.3 of the draft: mandates what communities are in use and
    what their specific behavior should be. For example: "The "LLGR_STALE"
    community must be advertised by the GR helper and also MUST NOT be removed
    by other receiving peers." and anyone that receives that route MUST treat
    the route as least-preferred. This isnt the case for ERR. There arent any
    communities attached to Stale routes thereby mandating their depreference.
*   Section 4.7: Different conditions for partial deployment of LLGR is a no-op
    for ExRR as it builds on the concepts of RFC8538 and hence there arent any
    special communities expected to be sent or received for the stale routes.

**More about the ExRR policy**

*   This policy can be attached at the Global, Peer-group or Neighbor levels. *
    The routes passed through the retention-policy should be the post-policy
    adj-rib-in of the neighbor. Any other import policy applied to the routes
    must not be overridden by this policy, it should be additive.
*   Default action if no ExRR policy is specified should be to follow RFC8538
    behavior.
*   Please Note: In the case of an ExRR policy, when the action of a given MATCH
    criteria is REJECT, the matching prefixes will be treated similar to RFC8538
    expectations. Therefore such prefixes wouldnt experience extended Retention.
    Similarly, when the policy match condition translates to an ACCEPT action,
    the prefixes are considered for ExRR operation and the configured Retention
    time becomes applicable. The Prefix also gets other attributes as configured
    part of ACTION
*   Yang definitions for ExRR is proposed in
    [pull/1319](https://github.com/openconfig/public/pull/1319). Following is a
    representation of how the entire config/state used in this test will look
    like.

## Procedure

## RT-1.35.1: Baseline Validation and Long-Duration Timer Configuration

*   Validate that BGP peers have exchanged graceful-restart capabilities
    (capability 64) i.e. the "N" bit (the second most significant bit) is set.
    Verify this on the ATEs.
*   Verify that the restart-time = 220 Secs. Check this using OC data.
*   Configure and validate a long-duration retention timer. In addition to the
    300-second timer used for the functional tests here, configure the ERR
    retention-time to a large value \[minimum 180 days(15552000 seconds) but if
    the vendor suppots larger value, pick the highest\] and
    verify that the DUT accepts and reflects this value in its configuration
    state. This validates the requirement for long-lived retention, even if
    waiting for expiration is impractical for testing . Revert to 300 seconds
    for subsequent tests. Validate the configurations using OC.

    /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/neighbors/neighbor/graceful-restart/extended-route-retention/state/retention-time
    ```
*   Validate ExRR retention-policy is set to "STALE-ROUTE-POLICY".
    ```
    /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/neighbors/neighbor/graceful-restart/extended-route-retention/state/retention-policy`
    ```
    a. Verify that all prefixes are learned correctly on the DUT. Check the AFT
    entries for the same. On the ATEs, ensure that all the prefixes are learnt
    with the correct initial BGP attributes (communities, local-preference, MED)
    as per the import policies

      *   IPv4Prefix1 and IPv6Prefix1 has community NO-ERR
      *   IPv4Prefix2 and IPv6Prefix2 has community ERR-NO-DEPREF
      *   IPv4Prefix3 and IPv6Prefix3 has community TEST-IBGP and has a
          local-preference of 200
      *   IPv4Prefix4 and IPv6Prefix4 has community NO-ERR
      *   IPv4Prefix5 and IPv6Prefix5 has community ERR-NO-DEPREF
      *   IPv4Prefix6 and IPv6Prefix6 has community TEST-EBGP and also has a MED
          value of 50

    b. On ATE:Port1, ensure the following received from DUT: 
      * IPv4Prefix4 and IPv6Prefix4 with community NO-ERR 
      * IPv4Prefix5 and IPv6Prefix5 with community ERR-NO-DEPREF 
      * IPv4Prefix6 and IPv6Prefix6 prefixes are received with a MED of 50 and has the 
      community TEST-EBGP and NEW-EBGP in that order.

    c. On ATE:Port2, ensure the following received from DUT:
       * IPv4Prefix1 and IPv6Prefix1 has community NO-ERR
       * IPv4Prefix2 and IPv6Prefix2 has community ERR-NO-DEPREF
       * IPv4Prefix3 and IPv6Prefix3 has community TEST-IBGP and NEW-IBGP in that
       order. Also, ensure that these prefixes have an AS-PATH of "100, 100, 100"
       * Start traffic as per the Test flows above and ensure 100% success

    If any of the above verifications fail, then the test is a failure.

    ```

## RT-1.35.2: DUT as Helper for a (gracefully) Restarting Peer

*   Trigger: From ATE:Port1 and ATE:Port2, gracefully terminate the BGP sessions
    with the DUT (e.g., by sending a BGP Cease NOTIFICATION).
*   Prevent the ATEs from re-establishing their BGP sessions for 280
        seconds. This duration is longer than the configured stale-routes-time
        (250s) but shorter than the ExRR retention-time (300s), ensuring the DUT
        transitions from standard Graceful Restart into the ExRR state.
*   Verify traffic behavior:
    *   Prefixes with community NO-ERR (policy action REJECT) should
        stop forwarding after the stale-routes-time (250s) expires. This
        confirms the REJECT action in the ExRR policy removes the route
        from being held.
    *   Prefixes with community ERR-NO-DEPREF should continue forwarding
        and have the STALE community added.
    *   All other prefixes should continue forwarding, have their
        local-preference set to 0, and have the STALE community added.
*   Allow BGP to re-establish after 280 seconds and verify a return to the baseline state.
*   Validation: Ensure the ATEs receive an End-of-RIB marker for the v4 and v6 peerings from the DUT after all routes are re-advertised. End-of-RIB marker is an empty BGP update message.

## RT-1.35.3 ATE Peer Abrupt Termination (Hold-Timer Expiry)

*   Trigger: From ATE:Port1 and ATE:Port2, abruptly stop sending BGP messages,
    including keepalives, to the DUT. This will cause the BGP hold-timer to
    expire on the DUT.
*   The DUT should enter Graceful Restart helper mode. Prevent the ATEs from
    re-establishing their BGP sessions for 280 seconds.
*   Verification: The expected behavior and traffic verification steps are
    identical to the graceful termination test (RT-1.35.2) above, as the DUT
    should trigger its ExRR logic once the stale-routes-time expires.


## RT-1.35.4: BGP Notification Handling (Graceful Teardown), "Administrative Reset" Notification (rfc4486) sent by the DUT

`TODO: gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_GRACEFUL_RESET used in this case is under
review in https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/pull/214`

*   Start traffic as per the flows above
*   Trigger BGP Notification (code 6 subocde 4) from DUT:Port1 towards
    ATE:Port1. Please use the `gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_GRACEFUL_RESET`
    message.
*   Cease notification of Code 6, subcode 4 will result in tcp connection reset
    but the routes aren't flushed
*   Configure ATE:Port1 to not send/accept any more TCP connections from the
    DUT:Port1 until the "reset timer" on the DUT expires.
*   Expected behavior is the same as RT-1.35.2
*   Revert ATE configuration to allow for the BGP sessions to be up. Restart
    traffic and confirm that there is zero packet loss. Expected behavior is
    same as the base test in RT-1.35.1
*   Restart the above procedure for the EBGP peering between DUT:Port-2 and
    ATE:Port-2

## RT-1.35.5: BGP Notification Handling (Graceful Teardown), "Administrative Reset" Notification (rfc4486) received by the DUT

`TODO: gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_GRACEFUL_RESET used in this case is under
review in https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/pull/214`

*   Follow the same procedure as RT-1.35.6 above. However this time, Trigger BGP
    Notification (code 6 subocde 4) from ATE:Port1 towards DUT:Port1. Please use
    the `gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_GRACEFUL_RESET` message.
*   Expected result is same as RT-1.35.2 above
*   Revert ATE configurtion to allow for the BGP sessions to be up. Restart
    traffic and confirm that there is zero packet loss. Expected behavior is
    same as the base test in RT-1.35.1
*   Restart the above procedure for the EBGP peering between DUT:Port-2 and
    ATE:Port-2

## RT-1.35.6: BGP Notification Handling (Hard Reset) sent by the DUT.

`TODO: gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_HARD_RESET used in this case is under review
in https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/pull/214`

*   Start traffic as per the flows above
*   Trigger BGP "HARD RESET" Notification from the DUT:Port1 and DUT:Port2
    towards ATE:Port1 and ATE:Port2 respectively by using
    `gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_HARD_RESET` message of the gNOI PROTO.
*   As per
    [rfc8538#section-3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8538#section-3.1),
    when "N bit" exchanged between peers (i.e. GR negotiated), the "HARD RESET"
    notification of code 6 subcode 9 must be sent to the peer. However, the
    subcode for "Administrative Reset" i.e. code 6 subcode 4 must be carried in
    the data portion of subcode 9 notification message.
*   On receipt of the "HARD RESET" Notification message from the DUT, the ATEs
    MUST validate the Notification message and ensure it matches the bullet
    above.
*   Given the HARD_RESET received, the DUT must RESET the TCP and flush all
    routes resulting in 100% packet loss for all the flows irrespective of the
    ExRR configuration and the `STALE-ROUTE-POLICY`. The test MUST fail if this
    isnt the behavior seen. Verficiation of packet loss done on the ATE side as
    well as on the DUT using the following OC path.
    `/interfaces/interface/state/counters/out-unicast-pkts`
*   As soon as the BGP peering are up again between the ATEs and the DUT,
    traffic flow must be successful and the expected behavior must be the same
    as RT-1.35.1

## RT-1.35.7: BGP Notification Handling (Hard Reset) received by the DUT

`TODO: gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_HARD_RESET used in this case is under review
in https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/pull/214`

*   Start traffic as per the flows above
*   Trigger BGP "HARD RESET" Notification from the ATE:Port1 to DUT:Port1 by
    sending `gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_HARD` message to ATE:Port1. When this
    happens and the DUT recieves BGP cease notification with subcode 9, the DUT
    is expected to FLUSH all IBGP learnt routes irrespective of the ERR
    configuration and therefore traffic between the flows will see 100% failure.
*   Once the IBGP peering is reestablished, expected behavior is the same as
    RT-1.35.1
*   Repeat the above process by sending gNOI.ClearBGPNeighborRequest_HARD to the
    ATE:Port2. Expected behavior here is the same as seen for the IBGP peering.

## RT-1.35.8: Additive Policy Application

Verify that the ExRR retention policy is additive to the standard import policy.

*   In addition to the existing importibgp policy that sets local-preference to
    200, add an action to set the MED to 150 for prefixes with community
    TEST-IBGP.
*   In the baseline state, verify IPv4Prefix3 and IPv6Prefix3 have both
    local-preference 200 and MED 150. Use the loc-rib state paths below.
*   Trigger an ExRR state as in RT-1.35.2. The STALE-ROUTE-POLICY should apply a
    local-preference of 0. Verify using the LOC-RIB path below.
*   During the ExRR state, verify that the prefixes now have a local-preference
    of 0 (from ExRR policy), a MED of 150 (from import policy), and the STALE
    community (from ExRR policy).
*   This confirms the retention policy does not override pre-existing attributes
    set by other policies. If the behavior is different from this expectation
    then fail the test.

 /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/rib/afi-safis/afi-safi/ipv4-unicast/loc-rib/routes/route/state/attr-index
```

## RT-1.35.9: Default Reject Behavior

Verify that the default behavior is to drop stale routes when ExRR is enabled but
no policy is attached. 

* Enable ExRR on the DUT but do not configure a retention-policy. 
* Trigger a BGP session failure on the ATEs that would normally activate ExRR 
(e.g., as in RT-1.35.2). 
* Verify that after the restart-timer expires, all routes from the failed 
neighbor are flushed and traffic for all flows drops to 0%. Validate on the ATE 
as well as using OC.
`/interfaces/interface/state/counters/out-unicast-pkts` 
* Test Must fail if the default action without ExRR isn't satisfied.


## RT-1.35.10: Consecutive BGP Restarts

Verify that ExRR is correctly triggered during rapid, consecutive session
failures. This test addresses the specific, complex failure scenario where
timers may not expire normally due to flapping.

* Establish a baseline state with active traffic.
* Initiate a loop on the ATE peer: gracefully kill the BGP
process, wait for the session to re-establish with the DUT, and then immediately
kill it again. This cycle should be shorter than the DUT's stale-routes-time.
Check the BGP peering state on the ATEs as well as using OC.
`/network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/neighbors/neighbor/state/session-state`
* After several such cycles, stop the loop and prevent the ATE from
reconnecting.
* Verify that the DUT enters the ExRR state and holds the routes
according to the STALE-ROUTE-POLICY, as validated in RT-1.35.2.


## RT-1.35.11

Repeat the tests above, with ExRR configuration under the peer-group hierarchy.
