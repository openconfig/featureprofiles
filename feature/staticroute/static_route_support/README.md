## Testbed type

*   https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_4.testbed

## Procedure

#### Initial Setup:

*   Connect DUT port-1, port-2 and port-3 to ATE port-1, port-2 and port-3 respectively
*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on DUT and ATE the interfaces
*   Configure one IPv4 destination i.e. ```ipv4-network = 192.168.10.0/24``` connected to ATE port 1 and 2
*   Configure one IPv6 destination i.e. ```ipv6-network = 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` connected to ATE port 1 and 2

### RT-1.26.1 [TODO: https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/2489]
#### Test to validate static route ECMP

*   Configure IPv4 static routes:
    *   Configure one IPv4 static route i.e. ipv4-route-a on the DUT for destination ```ipv4-network 192.168.10.0/24``` with the next hop set to the IPv4 address of ATE port-1
    *   Configure another IPv4 static route i.e. ipv4-route-b on the DUT for destination ```ipv4-network 192.168.10.0/24``` with the next hop set to the IPv4 address of ATE port-2
*   Validate both the routes i.e. ipv4-route-[a|b] are configured and reoported correctly
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/prefix
*   Configure IPv6 static routes:
    *   Configure one IPv6 static route i.e. ipv6-route-a on the DUT for destination ```ipv6-network 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` with the next hop set to the IPv6 address of ATE port-1
    *   Configure another IPv6 static route i.e. ipv6-route-b on the DUT for destination ```ipv6-network 2024:db8:128:128::/64``` with the next hop set to the IPv6 address of ATE port-2
*   Validate both the routes i.e. ipv6-route-[a|b] sre configured and reported correctly
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/prefix
*   Initiate traffic from ATE port-3 towards destination ```ipv4-network 192.168.10.0/24``` and ```ipv6-network 2024:db8:128:128::/64```
*   Validate that traffic is received from DUT on both port-1 and port-2 and ECMP works

### RT-1.26.2 [TODO: https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/2489]
#### Test to validate static route metric

*   Configure metric of ipv4-route-b and ipv6-route-b to 1000
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/next-hops/next-hop/config/metric
*   Validate that the metric is set correctly
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/next-hops/next-hop/state/metric
*   Initiate traffic from ATE port-3 towards destination ```ipv4-network 192.168.10.0/24``` and ```ipv6-network 2024:db8:128:128::/64```
*   Validate that traffic is received from DUT on port-1 and not on port-2

### RT-1.26.3 [TODO: https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/2489]
#### Test to validate static route prefrence 

*   Configure preference of ipv4-route-a and ipv6-route-a to 200
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/next-hops/next-hop/config/preference
*   Validate that the preference is set correctly
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/next-hops/next-hop/state/preference
*   Initiate traffic from ATE port-3 towards destination ```ipv4-network 192.168.10.0/24``` and ```ipv6-network 2024:db8:128:128::/64```
*   Validate that traffic is now received from DUT on port-2 and not on port-1

### RT-1.26.4 [TODO: https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/2489]
#### Test to validate static route tag

*   Configure a tag of value 10 on ipv4-route-a and ipv6-route-a
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/config/set-tag
*   Validate the tag is set
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/state/set-tag

### RT-1.26.5 [TODO: https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/2489]
#### Test to validate IPv6 static route with IPv4 next-hop

*   Change the IPv6 next-hop of the ipv6-route-a with the next hop set to the IPv4 address of ATE port-1
*   Change the IPv6 next-hop of the ipv6-route-b with the next hop set to the IPv4 address of ATE port-2
*   Validate both the routes i.e. ipv6-route-[a|b] are configured and the IPv4 next-hop is reported correctly
