## Procedure

#### Initial Setup:

*   Connect DUT port-1, port-2 and port-3 to ATE port-1, port-2 and port-3
    respectively
*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on DUT and ATE the interfaces
*   Configure one IPv4 destination i.e. `ipv4-network = 203.0.113.0/24`
    connected to ATE port 1 and 2
*   Configure one IPv6 destination i.e. `ipv6-network = 2001:db8:128:128::/64`
    connected to ATE port 1 and 2

### RT-1.26.1

#### Test to validate static route ECMP

*   Configure IPv4 static routes:
    *   Configure one IPv4 static route i.e. ipv4-route-a on the DUT for
        destination `ipv4-network 203.0.113.0/24` with the next hop set to the
        IPv4 address of ATE port-1
    *   Configure another IPv4 static route i.e. ipv4-route-b on the DUT for
        destination `ipv4-network 203.0.113.0/24` with the next hop set to the
        IPv4 address of ATE port-2
*   Validate both the routes i.e. ipv4-route-[a|b] are configured and reported
    correctly
    *   /network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/static-routes/static/prefix

    *   Configure one IPv6 static route i.e. ipv6-route-a on the DUT for
        destination `ipv6-network 2001:db8:128:128::/64` with the next hop set
        to the IPv6 address of ATE port-1
    *   Configure another IPv6 static route i.e. ipv6-route-b on the DUT for
        destination `ipv6-network 2001:db8:128:128::/64` with the next hop set
        to the IPv6 address of ATE port-2
