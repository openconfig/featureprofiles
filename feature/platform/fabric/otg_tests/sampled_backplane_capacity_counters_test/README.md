# gNMI-1.18: gNMI subscribe with sample mode for backplane capacity counters

## Summary
WBB is required to support gNMI Subscribe with SAMPLE or ON_CHANGE mode for various counters.
This test if to verify that DUT supports gNMI Subscribe with ON_CHANGE for backplane-facing-capacity

## Testbed type

*   https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed

## Procedure

### gNMI-1.18.1

*   Connect DUT port-1 and 2 to ATE port-1 and 2 respectively

    *   For MFF DUT ports 1 and 2 SHOULD be on different linecards

*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on the interfaces

*   Using gNMI subscribe with "ON_CHANGE" mode

    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/consumed-capacity

        *   consumed-capacity is the sum of the admin-up front panel interface speeds connected to the integrated-circuit

*   Ensure that we receieve the initial consumed-capacity metric

*   Set port-2 enabled=false

    *   Validate that we recieve a changed consumed-capacity metric of a higher value

*   Set port-2 enable=true

    *   Validate that we recieve a changed consumed-capacity metric matching the initial value

### gNMI-1.18.2 [TODO: https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/2323]

*   Use gNMI subscribe with "ON_CHANGE" mode for the below telemetry paths

    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/total
    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/total-operational-capacity
    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/available-pct

*   Make sure we recieve the initial metric for each of the telemetry paths

*   Disable two FABRIC components

    *   set /components/component/{fabric}/config/power-admin-state to POWER_DISABLED

*   Validate that we recieve changed metric of a lower value for the below telemetry paths

    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/total-operational-capacity
    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/available-pct

*   Ensure that the metric for the below telemetry path should not have changed hence no updated metric should be received

    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/total

*   Enable the FABRIC components that were disabled previously

    *   Set /components/component/{fabric}/config/power-admin-state to POWER_ENABLED

*   Validate that we recieve changed metric matching the initial metric for the below of the telemetry paths

    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/total-operational-capacity
    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/available-pct

*   Ensure that the metric for the below telemetry path should not have changed hence no updated metric should be received

    *   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/total

## Config parameter coverage

*   /interfaces/interface/config/enabled
*   /interfaces/interface/subinterfaces/subinterface/ipv4/config/enabled
*   /interfaces/interface/subinterfaces/subinterface/ipv6/config/enabled
*   /components/component/{fabric}/config/power-admin-state

## Telemetry parameter coverage

*   /components/component/integrated-circuit/backplane-facing-capacity/state/available-pct
