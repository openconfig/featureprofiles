# TRANSCEIVER-102: Telemetry: ZR terminal-device OC paths streaming.

## Summary

Validate ZR optics module reports telemetry data for all leaves in

```yaml
    /terminal-device/logical-channels/channel/:
```

## Procedure

*   Connect two ZR interfaces using a duplex LC fiber jumper such that TX
    output power of one is the RX input power of the other module.

*   To establish a point to point ZR link ensure the following:
      * Both transceivers state is enabled
      * Both transceivers are set to a valid operational mode
        example 1.      
      * Both transceivers are set to a valid target TX output power
        example -7 dBm.
      * Both transceivers are tuned to a valid centre frequency
        example 196.1 THz.

*   With the ZR link established as explained above, wait until
    both interfaces oper-status are UP and all the min/avg/max values are 
    populated. Then verify that the following ZR transceiver telemetry paths 
    exist and are streamed valid values for both ZR optics.

*   Emulate flaps with the following procedure:
    *   Enable a pair of ZR interfaces on the DUT as explained above.
    *   Disable interface and wait at least one sample interval.
    *   Enable interface.

*   Verify that all the static leaves (e.g., breakout-speed, part-no, ...) 
    are present and reports valid strings or enums before, during and after flap.

*   Verify all the other leaves reports valid value of decimal64 before, 
    during and after flap. For leaves with stats, ensure min <= avg/instant <= max.

**Note:** For min, max, and avg values, 10 second sampling is preferred. If 
          10 seconds is not supported, the sampling interval used must be
          specified by adding a deviation to the test.
