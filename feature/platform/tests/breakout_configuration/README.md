# PLT-1.1: Interface breakout Test

## Summary

Validate Interface breakout configuration.

## Procedure


*   This test is carried out for different breakout types
*   Connect DUT with ATE to all interfaces in the breakout port
*   Configure each interface with test IP addressing
*   Verify correct interface state and speed reported
*   Verify that DUT responds to ARP/ICMP on all tested interfaces
