# IC-1: Test aggregate drop counters for control-plane traffic

## Summary
This is to test the different control-plane counters under the pipeline container. 


## Procedure

* Test environment setup
    ```mermaid
    graph LR; 
    A[ATE1:interface1]  <-- L3 connection --> B[interface1:DUT];
    ```
    * Make a L3 connection between the ATE and the DUT. This doesnt have to be a lag bundle.


* IC-1.0.1 - Exercise aggregate counters

  * Generate significant amount of traffic with the IP Options field set. This can be Option type 7 for record route. Also set the TTL of the packet to "1".
  * Check changes in the different state paths under the pipeline-counters container.
  * Check if the NOS has support for the leaves under the `vendor` container to identify the type of packet causing Queue increase as well as changes in the drop counters.
