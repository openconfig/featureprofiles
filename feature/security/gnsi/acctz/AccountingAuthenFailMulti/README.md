# ACCTZ-7.1 - gNSI.acctz.v1 (Accounting) Test Accounting Authentication Failure - Multi-transaction

## Summary
Test Accounting for authentication failures of multi-transaction logins

## Procedure

- Record the time T0 for use later in this test
- For each of the supported RecordResponse.service_request.service_type that is not authenticated per-transaction:
	- Connect to the DUT, recording the local and remote IP addresses and port numbers,
	- Provide invalid user credentials (including an empty username, unconfigured username, empty password, invalid password, wrong SSH key/certificate, etc),
	- disconnect
- Establish gNSI connection to the DUT.
- Call gnsi.acctz.v1.Acctz.RecordSubscribe with RecordRequest.timestamp = T0
- Verify that accurate accounting records are returned for the commands/RPCs authentication failures.
- If start/stop accounting is supported, each authentication failure should have an accompanying LOGIN accounting record.
- For each RecordResponse correlated to each connection made above, check/confirm that:
	- session_info. :
		- .{layer4_proto, local_address, local_port, remote_address, remote_port}, ip_proto must match those recorded earlier
		- channel_id = 0 for ssh and grpc.
		- .tty must be populated and correct, if applicable to the platform & access method, else omitted
		- .status must equal LOGIN:
			- .authen.type must equal the authentication method used.
			- .authen.status must equal FAIL, and cause should be populated.
			- .authen.cause should be populated with reason(s) for the failure.
		- .user.identity must match the username sent to authenticate to the DUT
		- .user.privilege_level should be omitted.
	- timestamp is after (greater than) RecordRequest.timestamp
	- session_info.service_request.serivce_type must equal the service used.
	- cmd_service. or grpc_service: 
		- .service_type must equal the service used
		- all other fields should be omitted.
	- for authorization:
		- all other fields should be omitted.
	- task_ids might be populate with platform-specific information
