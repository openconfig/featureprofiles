# attestz: General enrollz and attestz tests

## Summary

In TPM enrollment workflow the switch owner verifies device's Initial Attestation Key (IAK) and Initial DevID (IDevID) certificates (signed by the switch vendor CA) and installs/rotates owner IAK (oIAK) and owner IDevID (oIDevID) certificates (signed by switch owner CA). In TPM attestation workflow switch owner verifies that the device's end-to-end boot state (bootloader, OS, secure boot policy, etc.) matches owner's expectations.

## Procedure

Test should verify all success and failure/corner-case scenarios for TPM enrollment and attestation workflows that are specified in [attestz Readme](https://github.com/openconfig/attestz/blob/main/README.md).

TPM enrollment workflow consists of two APIs defined in openconfig/attestz/blob/main/proto/tpm_enrollz.proto: `GetIakCert` and `RotateOIakCert`.
TPM attestation workflow consists of a single API defined in openconfig/attestz/blob/main/proto/tpm_attestz.proto: `Attest`.
The tests should comprehensively cover the behavior for all three APIs when used both separately and sequentially.
Finally, the tests should cover both initial install/bootstrapping, oIAK/oIDevID rotation and post-install re-attestation workflows.

## Test Setup

1. Switch vendor provisioned the device with IAK and IDevID certs following TCG spec [Section 5.2](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf#page=20) and [Section 6.2](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf#page=30).
2. The device successfully completed the bootz workflow where it obtained and applied all configurations/credentials/certificates and booted into the right OS image.
3. Device is serving `enrollz` and `attestz` gRPC endpoints.

### attestz-1: Validate attestz for initial install

The test validates that the device completes TPM enrollment and attestation during initial device bootstrapping/install.

| ID  | Case | Result |
| --- | ---- | ------ |
| attestz-1.1 | Successful enrollment and attestation | Device obtained oIAK and oIDevID certs, updated default SSL profile to rely on the oIDevID cert, and passed attestation for all control cards |
| attestz-1.2 | IAK/IDevID are not present on the device | `GetIakCert` fails with missing IAK/IDevID error |
| attestz-1.3 | Bad request for `GetIakCertRequest`, `RotateOIakCertRequest` and Â `AttestRequest`. Examples: `ControlCardSelection control_card_selection` is not specified or `control_card_id.role = 0`. Invalid `control_card_id.serial` or `control_card_id.slot` | `GetIakCert`, `RotateOIakCert` and `Attest` fail with detailed invalid request error |
| attestz-1.4 | Store oIAK/oIDevId certs that have different underlying IAK/IDevID pub keys or intended for other control card | `RotateOIakCert` fails with detailed invalid request error |
| attestz-1.5 | `enrollz` workflow followed by a device reboot still results in a successful `attestz` workflow | Device obtained oIAK and oIDevID certs and passed attestation for all control cards |
| attestz-1.6 | Full factory reset of the device after a successful `enrollz` workflow deletes oIAK and oIDevID certs, but does not affect IAK and IDevID certs | After factory reset the device fails to perform `attestz` workflow due to missing oIAK and oIDevID certs |
| attestz-1.7 | Out of bound or repeated `pcr_indices` in `AttestRequest` | `Attest` fails with detailed invalid request error |
| attestz-1.8 | RMA scenarios where an active control card ensures that a newly inserted standby control card completes TPM enrollment and attestation before obtaining **its own set** of owner-issued production credentials/certificates (no sharing of owner-issued production security artifacts is allowed between control cards) | `attestz` on a newly inserted control card fails before the card successfully completes TPM enrollment workflow; all RPCs relying on owner-issued credentials/certs fail on a newly inserted control card before the card successfully completes TPM enrollment and attestation workflows |
| attestz-1.9 | Regardless of which control card was active during `enrollz`, both control cards should be able to successfully complete `attestz` workflow as active control cards | Device obtained oIAK and oIDevID certs and passed attestation for all control cards |

1. Call `GetIakCert` for an active control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`.
2. Verify that correct IDevID cert was used for establishing TLS session:
   * Cert structure matches TCG specification [Section 8](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf#page=55).
   * Cert is not expired.
   * Cert is signed by switch vendor CA.
   * Cert is tied to the active control card.
3. Verify IAK cert:
   * Cert structure matches TCG spec (similar to IDevID above).
   * Cert is not expired.
   * Cert is signed by switch vendor CA.
   * Cert is tied to the active control card.
   * IAK and IDevID cert contain the same device serial number field.
4. Verify that the device returned the correct `ControlCardVendorId` with all fields populated.
5. Issue owner IAK (oIAK) and owner IDevID (oIDevID) certs, which are based on the same underlying public keys, have the same structure and fields, but are signed by a different - owner - CA.
6. Call `RotateOIakCert` to store newly issued oIAK and oIDevID certs and verify successful response.
7. Call `GetIakCert` for a standby control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`.
8. Repeat step (2) (TLS session will be secured by active control card's IDevID) and verify IDevID cert of standby control card was specified in the response payload.
9. Repeat steps (3-6) for the standby control card.
10. Call `Attest` for active control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`, random nonce, hash algo of choice (all should be supported and tested) and all PCR indices.
11. Verify that the correct oIDevID cert was used for establishing TLS session.
12. Verify that the device returned the correct `ControlCardVendorId` with all fields populated.
13. Verify oIAK cert is the same as the one installed earlier.
14. Verify all `pcr_values` match expectations.
15. Verify `quote_signature` signature with oIAK cert.
16. Use `pcr_values` and `quoted` to recompute PCR Quote digest and verify that it matches the one used in `quote_signature`.
17. Call `Attest` for standby control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`, random nonce, hash algo of choice (all should be supported and tested) and all PCR indices.
18. Verify that the oIDevID cert of active control card was used for establishing TLS session and verify that oIDevID cert of standby control card was specified in the response payload.
19. Repeat steps (12-16) for the standby control card.

### attestz-2: Validate oIAK and oIDevID rotation

The test validates that the device can rotate oIAK and oIDevID certificates post-install.

| ID          | Case            | Result |
| ----------- | ----------------| ------ |
| attestz-2.1 | Successful oIAK and oIDevID cert rotation when no owner-issued mTLS cert is available on the device | Device obtained newly-rotated oIAK and oIDevID certs and passed attestation for all control cards relying on the new oIAK and oIDevID certs |
| attestz-2.2 | Successful oIAK and oIDevID cert rotation when owner-issued mTLS cert is available on the device | Device obtained newly-rotated oIAK and oIDevID certs and passed attestation for all control cards relying on the new oIAK and previously owner-issued mTLS cert |
| attestz-2.3 | Device is unable to authenticate switch owner (e.g. no suitable TLS trust bundle) during oIAK/oIDevID rotation | Both `GetIakCert` and `RotateOIakCert` return authentication failure error |

1. Execute "Initial Install" workflow.
2. Issue new oIAK and oIDevID certs for active control card, call `RotateOIakCert` to store those on the right card and verify successful response.
3. Issue new oIAK and oIDevID certs for standby control card, call `RotateOIakCert` to store those on the right card and verify successful response.
4. Call `Attest` for active and standby control cards and ensure they use the latest oIAK for attestation and, if there is no owner-provisioned TLS cert installed, use latest oIDevID for TLS session.
5. Do the same verification of attestation responses as in "Initial Install" workflow.

### attestz-3: Validate post-install re-attestation

The test validates that the device completes TPM attestation after initial bootstrapping when the device is already handling production traffic and has already been provisioned with oIAK cert and owner-issued mTLS credentials/certs to communicate with owner infrastructure.

| ID          | Case            | Result |
| ----------- | ----------------| ------ |
| attestz-3.1 | Successful post-install re-attestation relying an owner-issued mTLS cert | Device passed attestation for all control cards relying on the latest oIAK and mTLS certs |
| attestz-3.2 | Two re-attestations separated by a device reboot result in the same PCR values, but different PCR Quote (due a different random nonce in `AttestRequest`) | Device passed multiple re-attestations separated by a reboot for all control cards relying on the latest oIAK and mTLS certs |
| attestz-3.2 | When an active control card becomes unavailable, standby control card becomes active and can successfully complete re-attestation | Standby control card passed re-attestation after an active control card failure, relying on the latest oIAK and mTLS certs|
| attestz-3.3 | Device is unable to authenticate switch owner (e.g. no suitable TLS trust bundle) during attestation | `Attest` returns authentication failure error |

1. Execute "Initial Install" workflow.
2. Provision the device with switch owner mTLS credentials (separate key pair and cert for each control card).
3. Call `Attest` for active and standby control cards and ensure they use the new mTLS cert for TLS connection and the latest oIAK for attestation.
4. Do the same verification of attestation responses as in "Initial Install" workflow.
