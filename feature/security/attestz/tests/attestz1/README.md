# attestz-1: Validate attestz for initial install

## Summary

In TPM enrollment workflow the switch owner verifies device's Initial Attestation Key (IAK) and Initial DevID (IDevID) certificates (signed by the switch vendor CA) and installs/rotates owner IAK (oIAK) and owner IDevID (oIDevID) certificates (signed by switch owner CA). In TPM attestation workflow switch owner verifies that the device's end-to-end boot state (bootloader, OS, secure boot policy, etc.) matches owner's expectations.

## Procedure

Test should verify all success and failure/corner-case scenarios for TPM enrollment and attestation workflows that are specified in [attestz Readme](https://github.com/openconfig/attestz/blob/main/README.md).

TPM enrollment workflow consists of two APIs defined in openconfig/attestz/blob/main/proto/tpm_enrollz.proto: `GetIakCert` and `RotateOIakCert`.
TPM attestation workflow consists of a single API defined in openconfig/attestz/blob/main/proto/tpm_attestz.proto: `Attest`.
The tests should comprehensively cover the behavior for all three APIs when used both separately and sequentially.
Finally, the tests should cover both initial install/bootstrapping, oIAK/oIDevID rotation and post-install re-attestation workflows.

## Test Setup

1. Switch vendor provisioned the device with IAK and IDevID certs following TCG spec [Section 5.2](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf#page=20) and [Section 6.2](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf#page=30).
2. The device successfully completed the bootz workflow where it obtained and applied all configurations/credentials/certificates and booted into the right OS image.
3. Device is serving `enrollz` and `attestz` gRPC endpoints.

### attestz-1: Validate attestz for initial install

The test validates that the device completes TPM enrollment and attestation during initial device bootstrapping/install.

| ID  | Case | Result |
| --- | ---- | ------ |
| attestz-1.1 | Successful enrollment and attestation | Device obtained oIAK and oIDevID certs, updated default SSL profile to rely on the oIDevID cert, and passed attestation for all control cards |
| attestz-1.2 | IAK/IDevID are not present on the device | `GetIakCert` fails with missing IAK/IDevID error |
| attestz-1.3 | Bad request for `GetIakCertRequest`, `RotateOIakCertRequest` and Â `AttestRequest`. Examples: `ControlCardSelection control_card_selection` is not specified or `control_card_id.role = 0`. Invalid `control_card_id.serial` or `control_card_id.slot` | `GetIakCert`, `RotateOIakCert` and `Attest` fail with detailed invalid request error |
| attestz-1.4 | Store oIAK/oIDevId certs that have different underlying IAK/IDevID pub keys or intended for other control card | `RotateOIakCert` fails with detailed invalid request error |
| attestz-1.5 | `enrollz` workflow followed by a device reboot still results in a successful `attestz` workflow | Device obtained oIAK and oIDevID certs and passed attestation for all control cards |
| attestz-1.6 | Full factory reset of the device after a successful `enrollz` workflow deletes oIAK and oIDevID certs, but does not affect IAK and IDevID certs | After factory reset the device fails to perform `attestz` workflow due to missing oIAK and oIDevID certs |
| attestz-1.7 | Out of bound or repeated `pcr_indices` in `AttestRequest` | `Attest` fails with detailed invalid request error |
| attestz-1.8 | RMA scenarios where an active control card ensures that a newly inserted standby control card completes TPM enrollment and attestation before obtaining **its own set** of owner-issued production credentials/certificates (no sharing of owner-issued production security artifacts is allowed between control cards) | `attestz` on a newly inserted control card fails before the card successfully completes TPM enrollment workflow; all RPCs relying on owner-issued credentials/certs fail on a newly inserted control card before the card successfully completes TPM enrollment and attestation workflows |
| attestz-1.9 | Regardless of which control card was active during `enrollz`, both control cards should be able to successfully complete `attestz` workflow as active control cards | Device obtained oIAK and oIDevID certs and passed attestation for all control cards |

1. Call `GetIakCert` for an active control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`.
2. Verify that correct IDevID cert was used for establishing TLS session:
   * Cert structure matches TCG specification [Section 8](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf#page=55).
   * Cert is not expired.
   * Cert is signed by switch vendor CA.
   * Cert is tied to the active control card.
3. Verify IAK cert:
   * Cert structure matches TCG spec (similar to IDevID above).
   * Cert is not expired.
   * Cert is signed by switch vendor CA.
   * Cert is tied to the active control card.
   * IAK and IDevID cert contain the same device serial number field.
4. Verify that the device returned the correct `ControlCardVendorId` with all fields populated.
5. Issue owner IAK (oIAK) and owner IDevID (oIDevID) certs, which are based on the same underlying public keys, have the same structure and fields, but are signed by a different - owner - CA.
6. Call `RotateOIakCert` to store newly issued oIAK and oIDevID certs and verify successful response.
7. Call `GetIakCert` for a standby control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`.
8. Repeat step (2) (TLS session will be secured by active control card's IDevID) and verify IDevID cert of standby control card was specified in the response payload.
9. Repeat steps (3-6) for the standby control card.
10. Call `Attest` for active control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`, random nonce, hash algo of choice (all should be supported and tested) and all PCR indices.
11. Verify that the correct oIDevID cert was used for establishing TLS session.
12. Verify that the device returned the correct `ControlCardVendorId` with all fields populated.
13. Verify oIAK cert is the same as the one installed earlier.
14. Verify all `pcr_values` match expectations.
15. Verify `quote_signature` signature with oIAK cert.
16. Use `pcr_values` and `quoted` to recompute PCR Quote digest and verify that it matches the one used in `quote_signature`.
17. Call `Attest` for standby control card with correct `ControlCardSelection`, random nonce, hash algo of choice (all should be supported and tested) and all PCR indices.
18. Verify that the oIDevID cert of active control card was used for establishing TLS session and verify that oIDevID cert of standby control card was specified in the response payload.
19. Repeat steps (12-16) for the standby control card.
