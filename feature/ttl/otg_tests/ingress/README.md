# PF-1.8: Ingress handling of TTL

## Summary

This test verifies TTL handling for ingress flows.

## Testbed Type

*  [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_2.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed)

## Procedure

### Test environment setup

*   DUT has one ingress port and one egress port, both connected to ATE.

    ```
                              -------
                             |       |
          [ ATE:Port1 ] ---- |  DUT  | ---- [ ATE:Port2 ]
                             |       |
                              -------
    ```

*   Traffic is generated from ATE:Port1.
*   ATE:Port2 is used as the destination port for flows.

#### Configuration

1.  DUT:Port1 is configured as Singleton IP interface towards ATE:Port1
    with IPv4 and IP6 addresses.

2.  DUT:Port2 is configured as Singleton IP interface towards ATE:Port2
    with IPv4 and IP6 addresses.

3.  DUT is configured with the following static routes:
    a) Destination IPv4-DST-NET/32 next hop ATE:Port2 IPv4 address.
    b) Destination IPv6-DST-NET/32 next hop ATE:Port2 IPv6 address.
    c) Destination IPv4-DST-NET-SERV1/32 next hop ATE:Port2 IPv4 address.
    d) Destination IPv6-DST-NET-SERV1/32 next hop ATE:Port2 IPv6 address.
    c) Destination GRE-IPv4-DST-NET/32 next hop ATE:Port2 IPv4 address.

### PF-1.8.1: IPv4 traffic with no encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 10.

ATE action:

*   Generate 5 **IPv4 packets** from ATE:Port1 to IPv4-DST-NET/32.
    *   Set TTL of all packets to *10*.

Verify:

*   DUT interface DUT:Port1 `in-unicast-pkts` counters equals the number of
    packets generated from ATE:Port1.
*   DUT interface DUT:Port2 `out-unicast-pkts` counters equals the number of
    packets generated from ATE:Port1.
*   The packet count of traffic received on ATE:Port2 should be equal to the
    packets generated from ATE:Port1.
*   For ONLY non-encapsulated packets; TTL for all packets received on ATE:Port2
    should be *9*.

### PF-1.8.2: IPv6 traffic with no encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 10.

*   Repeat `PF-1.8.1` with ATE generating IPv6 packets IPv6-DST-NET/128.

### PF-1.8.3: IPv4 traffic with no encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 1.

ATE action:

*   Generate 5 **IPv4 packets** from ATE:Port1 to IPv4-DST-NET/32.
    *   Set TTL of all packets to *1*.

Verify:

*   DUT interface DUT:Port1 `in-unicast-pkts` counters equals the number of
    packets generated from ATE:Port1.
*   ATE:Port1 received ICMP TTL Exceeded packets for all packets sent.

### PF-1.8.4: IPv6 traffic with no encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 1.

*   Repeat `PF-1.8.3` with ATE generating IPv6 packets IPv6-DST-NET/128.

### PF-1.8.5: IPv4 traffic with GRE encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 10.

DUT action:

*   Configure DUT for GRE encapsulation as follows.
    *   Packets destined to IPv4-DST-NET-SERV1/32 should be GRE encapsulated
        to GRE-IPv4-DST-NET/32 with outer IP having TTL = 64.
    *   Packets destined to IPv6-DST-NET-SERV1/128 should be GRE encapsulated
        to GRE-IPv4-DST-NET/32 with outer IP having TTL = 64.

ATE action:

*   Generate 5 **IPv4 packets** from ATE:Port1 to IPv4-DST-NET-SERV1/32.
    *   Set TTL of all packets to *10*.

Verify:

*   Perform same verifications in `PF-1.8.1`.
    *   TTL for inner IP is 10.
    *   TTL for outer IP is 64.
    *   In addition, verify that encapsulation rules counter match number of
    packets from ATE:Port1.

### PF-1.8.6: IPv6 traffic with GRE encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 10.

*   Repeat `PF-1.8.5` with ATE generating IPv6 packets IPv6-DST-NET-SERV1/128.

### PF-1.8.7: IPv4 traffic with GRE encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 1 with DUT configured to process TTL = 1 on receiving interface.

DUT action:

*   Additional configuration on DUT
    *   Packets with TTL = 1 should be processed locally first before encapsulation.

ATE action:

*   Generate 5 **IPv4 packets** from ATE:Port1 to IPv4-DST-NET-SERV1/32.
    *   Set TTL of all packets to *1*.

Verify:

*   DUT interface DUT:Port1 `in-unicast-pkts` counters equals the number of
    packets generated from ATE:Port1.
*   ATE:Port1 received ICMP Time Exceeded packets for all packets sent.

### PF-1.8.8: IPv6 traffic with GRE encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 1 with DUT configured to process TTL = 1 on receiving interface.

*   Repeat `PF-1.8.7` with ATE generating IPv6 packets IPv6-DST-NET-SERV1/128.

### PF-1.8.9: IPv4 traffic with GRE encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 1 with DUT configured NOT to process TTL = 1 on receiving interface.

DUT action:

*   Additional configuration on DUT
    *   Packets with TTL = 1 should be encapsulated and not processed locally.

ATE action:

*   Generate 5 **IPv4 packets** from ATE:Port1 to IPv4-DST-NET-SERV1/32.
    *   Set TTL of all packets to *1*.

Verify:

*   Perform same verifications in `PF-1.8.5`.

### PF-1.8.10: IPv6 traffic with GRE encapsulation on DUT and TTL = 1 with DUT configured NOT to process TTL = 1 on receiving interface.

*   Repeat `PF-1.8.9` with ATE generating IPv6 packets IPv6-DST-NET-SERV1/128.
