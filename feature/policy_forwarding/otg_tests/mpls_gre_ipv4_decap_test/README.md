# PF-1.12: MPLSoGRE IPV4 decapsulation of IPV4/IPV6 payload 

## Summary
This test verifies MPLSoGRE decapsulation of IP traffic using static MPLS LSP configuration. MPLSoGRE Traffic on ingress to the DUT is decapsulated and IPV4/IPV6 payload is forwarded towards the IPV4/IPV6 egress nexthop.

## Testbed type
* [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_8.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_8.testbed)

## Procedure
### Test environment setup

```
DUT has 2 ingress aggregate interfaces and 1 egress aggregate interface.

                         |         | --eBGP-- | ATE Ports 3,4 |
    [ ATE Ports 1,2 ]----|   DUT   |          |               |
                         |         | --eBGP-- | ATE Port 5,6  |
```

Test uses aggregate 802.3ad bundled interfaces (Aggregate Interfaces).

* Ingress Ports: Aggregate2 and Aggregate3
    * Aggregate2 (ATE Ports 3,4) and Aggregate3 (ATE Ports 5,6) are used as the source ports for encapsulated traffic.

* Egress Ports: Aggregate1
    * Traffic is forwarded (egress) on Aggregate1 (ATE Ports 1,2) .

## PF-1.12.1: Generate config for MPLS in GRE decap and push to DUT
#### Configuration

#### Aggregate1 is the egress port having following configuration:

#### Ten subinterfaces (customer) with different VLAN-IDs

* Two VLANs with IPV4 link local address only, /29 address

* Two VLANs with IPV4 global /30 address

* Two VLANs with IPV6 address /125 only

* Four VLANs with IPV4 and IPV6 address

#### MTU Configuration
* One VLAN with MTU 9080 (including L2 header)

#### LLDP must be disabled

### Aggregate 2 and Aggregate 3 configuration

* IPV4 and IPV6 addresses

* MTU (default 9216)

* LACP Member link configuration

* Lag id

* LACP (default: period short)

* Carrier-delay (default up:3000 down:150)

* Statistics load interval (default:30 seconds)

### Routing

* MPLSoGRE decapsulation prefix range must be configurable on the device.  MPLSoGRE traffic within prefix ranges must be processed by the device.

* Static mapping of MPLS label to an egress nexthop must be configurable. Egress nexthop is based on the MPLS label/ static LSP.

* MPLS label for a single egress VLAN interface must be unique for decapsulated traffic:
    * IPV4 traffic
    * IPV6 traffic
    * Multicast traffic

* ECMP (Member links in Aggregate1) based on:
    * inner IP packet header  AND/OR
    * MPLS label, Outer IP packet header 

* Inner packet TTL and DSCP must be preserved during decap of traffic from MPLSoGRE to IP traffic

### MPLS Label 

* Entire Label block must be reallocated for static MPLS

* Labels from start/end/mid ranges must be usable and configured corresponding to MPLSoGRE decapsulation

### Multicast

* Multicast traffic must be decapsulated and sent out with L2 header based on the multicast payload address.

## NOTE: All test cases expected to meet following requirements even though they are not explicitly validated in the test.
* Egress routes are programmed and LACP bundles are up without any errors, chassis alarms or exception logs
* There is no recirculation (iow, no impact to line rate traffic. No matter how the port allocation is done) of traffic
* Header fields are as expected without any bit flips
* Multicast L2 rewrite/egress headers are correct based on the multicast payload IPV4 destination address
* Device must be able to resolve the ARP and IPV6 neighbors upon receiving traffic from ATE ports


## PF-1.12.2: Verify MPLSoGRE decapsulate action for IPv4 and IPV6 payload
Generate traffic on ATE Ports 3,4,5,6 having:
* Outer source address: random combination of 1000+ IPV4 source addresses from 100.64.0.0/22
* Outer destination address: Traffic must fall within the configured IPV4 unicast decap prefix range for MPLSoGRE traffic on the device
* MPLS Labels: Configure streams that map to every egress interface by having associated IPV4/IPV6/Multicast static MPLS labels in the MPLSoGRE header
* Inner payload: 
  * Both IPV4 and IPV6 unicast payloads, with random source address, destination address, TCP/UDP source port and destination ports
* Use 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.. MTU bytes frame size

Verify:
* All traffic received on Aggregate2 and Aggregate3 gets decapsulated and forwarded as IPV4/IPV6 unicast on the respective egress interfaces under Aggregate1
* No packet loss when forwarding with counters incrementing corresponding to traffic
* Traffic equally load-balanced across member links of the aggregate interfaces
  * Based on inner payload
  * Based on outer payload
  * Based on inner and outer payload

## PF-1.12.3: Verify MPLSoGRE decapsulate action for IPv4 and IPV6 payload with changes in IPV4 and IPV6 configs
Send traffic as in PF-1.12.2
* Remove and add IPV4 interface VLAN configs and verify that there is no IPV6 traffic loss
* Remove and add IPV6 interface VLAN configs and verify that there is no IPV4 traffic loss
* Remove and add IPV4 MPLSoGRE decap configs and verify that there is no IPV6 traffic loss
* Remove and add IPV6 MPLSoGRE decap configs and verify that there is no IPV4 traffic loss

## PF-1.12.4: Verify MPLSoGRE decapsulate action for IPv4 multicast payload
Generate traffic on ATE Ports 3,4,5,6 having:
* Outer source address: random combination of 1000+ IPV4 source addresses from 100.64.0.0/22
* Outer destination address: Traffic must fall within the configured IPV4 unicast decap prefix range for MPLSoGRE traffic on the device
* MPLS Labels: Configure streams that map to every egress interface by having associated IPV4/IPV6/Multicast static MPLS labels in the MPLSoGRE header
* Inner payload: 
  * Multicast traffic with random source address, TCP/UDP header with random source and destination ports
* Use 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.. MTU bytes frame size

Verify:

* No packet loss when forwarding with counters incrementing corresponding to traffic
* Traffic equally load-balanced across member links of the aggregate interfaces
  * Based on inner payload
  * Based on outer payload
  * Based on inner and outer payload

## PF-1.12.5: Verify MPLSoGRE DSCP/TTL preserve operation 
Generate traffic on ATE Ports 3,4,5,6 having:
* Outer source address: random combination of 1000+ IPV4 source addresses from 100.64.0.0/22
* Outer destination address: Traffic must fall within the configured IPV4 unicast decap prefix range for MPLSoGRE traffic on the device
* MPLS Labels: Configure streams that map to every egress interface by having associated IPV4/IPV6/Multicast static MPLS labels in the MPLSoGRE header

  * Both IPV4 and IPV6 unicast payloads, with random source address, destination address, TCP/UDP source port and destination ports
  * Multicast traffic with random source address, TCP/UDP header with random source and destination ports
* Use 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.. MTU bytes frame size

* No packet loss when forwarding with counters incrementing corresponding to traffic
* Traffic equally load-balanced across member links of the aggregate interfaces
* Header fields are as expected without any bit flips
* Inner payload DSCP and TTL values are not altered by the device

* Clear ARP entries and IPV6 neighbors on the device

Verify:
* No packet loss when forwarding with counters incrementing corresponding to traffic
