# PF-1.18 - MPLSoGRE and MPLSoGUE QoS 

## Summary
This test verifies quality of service with MPLSoGRE and MPLSoGUE IP traffic on routed VLAN sub interfaces. The classification, marking and queueing of traffic while being encapsulated and decapsulated based on the outer headers and/or inner payload are the major features verified on the test device.

## Testbed type
* [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_8.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_8.testbed)

## Procedure
### Test environment setup

```
DUT has 3 aggregate interfaces.


                         |         | --eBGP-- | ATE Ports 3,4 |
    [ ATE Ports 1,2 ]----|   DUT   |          |               |
                         |         | --eBGP-- | ATE Port 5,6  |
```

## Canonical OpenConfig for MACsec configuration

TODO: 
* Finalize and update the below paths after the review and testing on any vendor device
* MPLSoGRE/MPLSoGUE packet classification OC need to be defined
* OC for Queueing with shaper need to be defined
* Add json queueing configs in this file - b/408493684
