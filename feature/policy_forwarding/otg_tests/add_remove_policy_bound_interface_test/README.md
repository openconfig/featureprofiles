## Summary

For an interface that is bound to a PBF policy
*   Remove an interface bound to a policy
*   Add a new interface to the policy
*   Remove an interface from both a policy and the device

## Testbed type

* [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_4.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_4.testbed)

## Topology:

A[ATE] <-- Port2(IPv4/6) --> B[DUT];
```

## Procedure

### Initial setup

*   Connect DUT port-1, 2, 3 to ATE port-1, 2, 3 respectively

*   Configure IPv4/IPv6 addresses on DUT and ATE ports as shown below

    *   DUT port-1 IPv6 address ```dp1-v6 = 2001:DB2::1/126```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv6 address ```ap1-v6 = 2001:DB2::2/126```
    *   DUT port-1 IPv4 address ```dp1-v4 = 192.168.100.1/30```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv4 address ```ap1-v4 = 192.168.100.2/30```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv6 address ```dp2-v6 = 2001:DB2::5/126```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv6 address ```ap2-v6 = 2001:DB2::6/126```
    *   DUT port-2 IPv4 address ```dp1-v4 = 192.168.100.5/30```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv4 address ```ap1-v4 = 192.168.100.6/30```

    *   DUT port-3 IPv6 address ```dp2-v6 = 2001:DB2::9/126```
    *   ATE port-3 IPv6 address ```ap2-v6 = 2001:DB2::a/126```
    *   DUT port-3 IPv4 address ```dp1-v4 = 192.168.100.9/30```
    *   ATE port-3 IPv4 address ```ap1-v4 = 192.168.100.10/30```

*   Create a vrf on DUT `VRF-100` with no ports assigned to it.

*   Configure two IPv6 and two IPv4 static routes on DUT in VRF `VRF-100` towards ATE
    *   NOTE: It is not necessary for these networks to be configured on ATE. They are just used for traffic destinations
        *   Destination: `ipv6-net-a = 3008:DB8::/126` with next-hop `ap1-v6 = 2001:DB2::2/126` in vrf `VRF-100`
        *   Destination: `ipv6-net-b = 3009:DB9::/126` with next-hop `ap2-v6 = 2001:DB2::6/126` in vrf `VRF-100`
        *   Destination: `ipv4-net-a = 192.168.200.0/24` with next-hop `ap1-v4 = 192.168.100.2/30` in vrf `VRF-100`
        *   Destination: `ipv4-net-b = 192.168.300.0/24` with next-hop `ap1-v4 = 192.168.100.6/30` in vrf `VRF-100`
    *   NOTE: Default network instance should not have any static routes configured, above static routes should only be configured in `VRF-100`

*   Configure a forwarding policy type 'VRF_SELECTION_POLICY'
    *   Rule with sequence `10` to match:
        *   All IPv6 and IPv4 traffic
            *   source and destination is set to`ipv6 = ::/0` and `ipv4 = 0.0.0.0/0` 
        *   Set the action to match network instance `VRF-10`
    *   Apply the policy to DUT Port1 and Port2
        *   NOTE: DUT Port1, Port2 and Port3 are in `default vrf`

### PF-1.24.1 - Remove an interface bound to VRF Selection Policy

*   Remove DUT Port2 from the VRF Selection Policy
*   Start traffic from ATE port-3 towards
    *   `ipv6-net-a = 3008:DB8::/126`
    *   `ipv6-net-b = 3009:DB9::/126`
    *   `ipv4-net-a = 192.168.200.0/24`
    *   `ipv4-net-b = 192.168.300.0/24`
*   Validate the traffic is received on ATE Port1 only

### PF-1.24.2 - Add an interface bound to VRF Selection Policy

*   Add DUT Port2 to the VRF Selection Policy
*   Start traffic from ATE port-3 towards
    *   `ipv6-net-a = 3008:DB8::/126`
    *   `ipv6-net-b = 3009:DB9::/126`
    *   `ipv4-net-a = 192.168.200.0/24`
    *   `ipv4-net-b = 192.168.300.0/24`
*   Validate the traffic is received on ATE Port1 and Port2

### PF-1.24.3 - Remove an interface from both a policy and the device

*   Use gnmi batch replace to:
    *   Remove DUT Port2 from the VRF Selection Policy as well as from the device
*   Start traffic from ATE port-3 towards
    *   `ipv6-net-a = 3008:DB8::/126`
    *   `ipv6-net-b = 3009:DB9::/126`
    *   `ipv4-net-a = 192.168.200.0/24`
    *   `ipv4-net-b = 192.168.300.0/24`
*   Validate the traffic is received on ATE Port1 only
