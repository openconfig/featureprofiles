# PF-1.3: Static route based GUE Encapsulation to IPv4 tunnel

## Summary

This test verifies static route action to encapsulate packets in an
IPv4 GUE tunnel. The encapsulation is based on a statically configured GUE
tunnel.

The GUE header ((UDPoIP)) used in this test refers to GUE Variant 1 as specified
in
[draft-ietf-intarea-gue-09](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-intarea-gue-09).

The following behavioral properties are called out for awareness:

*   When the DSCP for the tunnel is not explicitly set, it is copied from the
    inner to the outer encapsulating header.
*   When the TTL for the tunnel is not explicitly set, it is decremented by 1
    and copied from inner to the outer encapsulating header. Except TTL=1, where
    Time Exceeded is sent back to the inner source IP.

## Testbed Type

*  [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_5.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_5.testbed)

## Procedure

### Test environment setup

*   DUT has 5 ports connected to ATE.

    ```
                              -------
                             |       | ==== LAG1 ==== [ ATE:Port2, ATE:Port3 ]
          [ ATE:Port1 ] ---- |  DUT  |
                             |       | ==== LAG2 ==== [ ATE:Port4, ATE:Port5 ]
                              -------
    ```

*   Routes are advertised from ATE:Port2, ATE:Port3, ATE:Port4 and ATE:Port5.
*   Traffic is generated from ATE:Port1.
*   ATE:Port2, ATE:Port3, ATE:Port4 and ATE:Port5 are used as the destination port for GUE encapsulated traffic.

#### Configuration

1.  DUT:Port1 is configured as Singleton IP interface towards ATE:Port1.

2.  DUT:Port2 and DUT:Port3 are configured as LAG1 IP interface towards
    ATE:Port2 and ATE:Port3 respectively.

3.  DUT:Port4 and DUT:Port5 are configured as LAG2 IP interface towards
    ATE:Port4 and ATE:Port5 respectively.

4.  DUT is configured to form two eBGP sessions with ATE using the directly
    connected LAG interface IPs.

5.  ATE:LAG1 and ATE:LAG2 are configured to advertise destination networks
    (IPv4-DST-NET, IPv6-DST-NET) and tunnel destination (IPv4-DST-GUE) to DUT.
    The protocol next hops for the destination networks should be re-configured
    as below:

    -   Destination network IPv4-DST-NET with protocol next hop PNH-IPv4.
    -   Destination network IPv6-DST-NET with protocol next hop PNH-IPv6.

6.  DUT is configured with an IPv4 GUE tunnel with destination IPv4-DST-GUE
    without any explicit tunnel Type of Service (ToS) or Time to Live (TTL)
    values.

7.  DUT is configured with the following static routes:

    -   To PNH-IPv4, next hop is the statically configured IPv4 GUE tunnel.
    -   To PNH-IPv6, next hop is the statically configured IPv4 GUE tunnel.
