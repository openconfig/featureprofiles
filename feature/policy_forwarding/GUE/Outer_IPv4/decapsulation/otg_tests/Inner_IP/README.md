# PF-1.4: Static GUEv1 Decapsulation to IPv4 or IPv6 payload

## Summary

This is to test the functionality of decapsulation of static GUEv1 to IPv4 or IPv6 payload ([GUE Variant 1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-intarea-gue-09#section-4)). These tests verify the use case of IPv4 and IPv6 encapsulated traffic in IPv4 GUE tuennel. 

The tests validate that the DUT performs the following action-

 - Decapsulate the outer ((UDPoIPv4)) headers of GUE packets destined to the locally configured decap IPv4 address/addresses and matching UDP port. 
    - The first two bits the UDP payload will be used to determine GUE varient 1 (MSB bits 01) and first four bits will determine the payload protocol IPv4/IPv6.
    - If the first four bits of the payload protocol has bit combination of 0100, it specifies the inner payload protocol is IPv4.
    - If the first four bits of the payload protocol has bit combination of 0110, it specifies the inner payload protocol is IPv6. 
 - Decapsulate the packet only if it matches the locally configured decap IPv4 address/addresses and matching UDP port port/port-range.
    - If not specifically configured, then the DST UDP port 6080 will be used as a match criteria for the decapsulation.
 - Post decapsulation the DUT should not copy outer TTL to inner header and maintain the inner DSCP vaule as is.
    - If explicit configration is present to copy the TTL from outer to inner header after decapsulation, then it will be honored.
 - Post decapsulation, the inner TTL value will be decremented before egressing to next-hop
 - Traffic not subject to match criteria will be forwared using the traditional IP forwarding.

## Procedure

### Test environment setup

* Create the following connections:
* DUT has ingress and egress port connected to the ATE.
  
```mermaid
graph LR; 
A[ATE:Port1] --Ingress--> B[Port1:DUT:Port2];B --Egress--> C[Port2:ATE];
```

### ATE Configuration

*  ATE Port 1: Generates GUE-encapsulated traffic
*  ATE Port 2: Receives traffic
  
* ATE Port 1 hosted prefixes:

  * ATE-Port1 IPV4 address = ATE-P1-Address
  * Additional Source Address = IPV4-SRC1
  * Additional Source Address = IPV6-SRC1 

* ATE Port 2 hosted prefixes:

  * ATE-Port2 IPV4 address = ATE-P2-Address
  * Additional destination address = IPV4-DST1
  * Additional destination address = IPV6-DST1

*  ATE Port 1 generates below flow types:
