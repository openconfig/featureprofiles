# PF-1.6: Policy based VRF selection for IPV4/IPV6

## Summary
This test ensures NOS is able to host multiple VRFs, and verify that VRF selection policy is working as intended.


## Test environment setup

### Topology
Create the following connections:
```mermaid
graph LR; 
subgraph ATE1 [ATE1]
    A1[Port1]
end
subgraph DUT1 [DUT1]
    B3[Port1-default VRF]
    B1[Port2-default VRF]
    B2[Port3-nondefault VRF]
end 
subgraph ATE2 [ATE2]
    C1[Port1]
    C2[Port2]
end
A1 <-- IBGP(ASN100) --> B3;
B1 <-- EBGP(ASN100:ASN200) --> C1;
B2 <-- EBGP(ASN100:ASN200)  --> C2;
B3 --> B1;
```
* Traffic Flow direction is from ATE1 --> ATE2

### Configuration generation of DUT and ATE

#### DUT Configuration
* Configure IBGP[ASN100] as described in topology between ATE1:Port1 and DUT1:Port1
* Configure EBGP[ASN200] between DUT1:Port2 and ATE2:Port1
* Configure EBGP[ASN200] between DUT1:Port3 and ATE2:Port2
* Port1 of DUT1 is connected to Port1 of ATE1
* Port2 of DUT1 which maps to Default VRF instance, is connected to Port1 of ATE2
* Port3 of DUT1 which maps to the non-default VRF instance, is connected to Port2 of ATE2
* Configure a policy based traffic steering from default to Non Default VRF, this policy should be able to steer the traffic from Default VRF to non default VRF and vice versa based on the destination IPv4/IPv6 address.
* DUT has the following VRF selection policy initially
    * Statement1: traffic matching IPv4Prefix1/24, forwards the traffic through default vrf
    * Statement2: traffic matching IPv4Prefix2/24, forwards the traffic through default vrf
    * Statement3: traffic matching IPv6Prefix3/64, forwards the traffic through default vrf
    * Statement4: traffic matching IPv6Prefix4/64, forwards the traffic through default vrf
    * Setup the Default VRF and the non-default VRF such that they share the same routes

#### ATE Configuration
* Configure IBGP[ASN100] on ATE1:Port1
* Configure EBGP[ASN200] on ATE2:Port1 & ATE2:Port2

### Configure ATE Route Advertisements & Traffic Flows as below:
#### ATE Route Advertisements:

  	ATE2:Port1 advertises following prefixes to DUT1:Port2 over EBGP
    - IPv4Prefix1/24
    - IPv4Prefix2/24
    - IPv6Prefix3/64
    - IPv6Prefix4/64

  	ATE2:Port2 advertieses following prefixes to DUT1:Port3 over EBGP
    - IPv4Prefix1/24
    - IPv4Prefix2/24
    - IPv6Prefix3/64
    - IPv6Prefix4/64

#### ATE traffic Flows:

	From ATE1:Port1 to ATE2 destination prefixes
    - IPv4Prefix1/24 at a rate of 100 packets/sec
    - IPv4Prefix2/24 at a rate of 100 packets/sec
    - IPv6Prefix3/64 at a rate of 100 packets/sec 
    - IPv6Prefix4/64 at a rate of 100 packets/sec


## Procedure

    * Statement3: traffic matching IPv6Prefix3/64, is forwarded through the default vrf
    * Statement4: traffic matching IPv6Prefix4/64, is forwarded through the default vrf

  * Validation

	* Traffic for Prefix 1 received from ATE1:Port1 once punted to non-defailt VRF by the VRF selection policy, must be received by ATE2:Port2
	* Traffic for rest of the prefixes sent by ATE1:Port1 must be routed to ATE2:Port1 via the DEFAULT VRF in the DUT.
         * Need to verify the packets sent by sender tester is equal to the packets on receiving tester ports 
	 * The flow packets sent for IPv4Prefix1/24 by ATE1:Port3 should be equal packets to DUT1:Port3 out-pkts counter.
	 *  The sum of packets sent for flow prefixes IPv4Prefix2/240, IPv6Prefix3/24 and IPv6Prefix4/24 should be equal packets to DUT1:Port2 out-pkts counter.
