# RT-7.5: BGP Policy - Match and Set Link Bandwidth Community

## Summary

Configure bgp policy to match, add and delete statically configured BGP link
bandwidth communities to routes based on a prefix match.

## Testbed type

* [2 port ATE to DUT](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed)

## Procedure

* Testbed configuration - Setup external BGP sessions and prefixes.
  * Generate config for 2 DUT and ATE ports where:
    * DUT port 1 to ATE port 1 EBGP session.
    * DUT port 2 to ATE port 2 IBGP session.
  * Configure dummy accept policies and attach it to both sessions on DUT.
     * Create a `/routing-policy/policy-definitions/policy-definition/policy-definition`
    named 'allow_all' with the following `statements`
       * statement[name='allow-all']/
         * actions/config/policy-result = ACCEPT_ROUTE
     * Use `/network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/neighbors/neighbor/afi-safis/afi-safi/apply-policy/config/import-policy`
      to apply the policy on the DUT bgp neighbor to the ATE port 1.
  * Configure ATE port 1 with a BGP session to DUT port 1.
    * Advertise ipv4 and ipv6 prefixes to DUT port 1 using the following communities:
      * prefix-set-1 with 2 ipv4 and 2 ipv6 routes without communities.
      * prefix-set-2 with 2 ipv4 and 2 ipv6 routes with communities `[ "100:100" ]`.
      * prefix-set-3 with 2 ipv4 and 2 ipv6 routes with extended communities `[ "link-bandwidth:100:0" ]`.
  * Configure Send community knob to IBGP neigbour to advertise the communities to IBGP peer 
    * use `/network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/neighbors/neighbor/config/send-community`.
* RT-7.5.1 - Validate bgp sessions and traffic
  * For IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes:
    * Observe received prefixes at ATE port-2.
  * Generate traffic from ATE port-2 to ATE port-1.
  * Verify traffic is received on ATE port 1 for advertised prefixes.
    routes.

* RT-7.5.2 - Validate adding and removing link-bandwidth ext-community-sets using OC model release 3.x
  * Configure the following extended community sets on the DUT:
    (prefix: `routing-policy/defined-sets/bgp-defined-sets/ext-community-sets/ext-community-set`)

      * LocalPreference
        The prefixes of "prefix-set-3" matching policy "rm_any_zero_bw_set_LocPref_5" should have Local Preference value 5.\
        All other prefixes, Local Preference should be none or 100 (standard default).\
        For all other policies, Local Preference should be none or 100 (standard default)

      * Regarding prefix-set-3 and policy "nomatch_100_set_linkbw_2G"
        * prefix-set-3 is advertised to the DUT with community "link-bandwidth:100:0" set.
        * The DUT evaluates a match for "regex_nomatch_as100".  This does not match because the regex pattern does not include the link-bandwidth community type.
        * Community linkbw_2G should be added.

      * Regarding policy-definition "match_linkbw_0_remove_and_set_localpref_5"
        * The link-bandwidth value 0 is interpreted by some implementation as weight "0" in WCMP group. In these implementations the remaining members distribute traffic according to weights.
        * Other implementations consider value 0 invalid or not having link-bandwidth. These implementations create ECMP group with all routes including this one, and ignores link-bandwidth of all members - distribute traffic equally.
        * This policy intention is to overcome this implementation difference, by deprefering (LocPref) routes with link-bandwidth 0 (only this routes) to prevent them becoming part of multipath, and remove link-bandwidth community so route will not be treated with WCMP behavior.
