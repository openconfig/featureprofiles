# RT-1.23: BGP AFI SAFI OC DEFAULTS

## Summary

BGP AFI SAFI OC DEFAULTS TEST

## Procedure

*   When operating in "openconfig mode", NOS (network operating system) defaults should match what OC 
    defines as the defaults i.e,
*   For BGP, there are no defaults for AFI-SAFI at the neighbor and peer-group levels. However at the
    global level the default is "false"
*   This test currently only verifies the defaults for ipv4-unicast and ipv6-unicast families.      
    However, this test can be extended further to cover for other AFI-SAFIs as well in future. 
*   The test will check for default implementations under the neighbor and peer-group hierarchies and 
    also test for inheritance rules as was specified in [pull/774](https://github.com/openconfig/public/pull/774) and [pull/815](https://github.com/openconfig/public/pull/815).


*   Topology:
    *   ATE (Port1) <-EBGP-> (Port1) DUT (Port2) <-IBGP-> (Port2) ATE
        *   Connect ATE Port1 to DUT port1 (EBGP peering)
        *   Connect ATE Port2 to DUT port2 (IBGP peering)

*   [Test case-1.1] AFI-SAFI configurations at "neighbor level":
    
    *   Push EBGP and IBGP OC configuration to the DUT 
        *   Configuration should include corresponding IPv4 and IPv6 neighbor configurations.
        *   Ensure that only IPv4-Unicast enabled boolean is made "true" for IPv4 neighbor.    
            "IPv6-unicast enabled" boolean is left to OC default for the IPv4 peer".
        *   Ensure that only IPv6-Unicast enabled boolean is made "true" for IPv6 neighbor. 
            "IPv4-unicast enabled" boolean is left to OC default for the IPv6 peer".
        *   Ensure that there are no AFI-SAFI configurations at the global and peer-group levels. 
        *   On the ATE side ensure that IPv4-unicast and IPv6-unicast AFI-SAFI are enabled==true for 
            IPv4 and IPv6 neighbors.
    
    *   Verification:
        *   For IPv4 neighbor, ensure that the IPv4 neighborship is up and IPv6-unicast capability is 
            not negotiated.
        *   For IPv6 neighbor ensure that the IPv6 neighborship is up and IPv4-unicast capability is 
            not negotiated.

*   [Test case-1.2] IPv4-unicast and IPv6-Unicast AFI-SAFIs enabled at peer-group level:
    
    *   Configuration at the neighbor level is same as in [Test case-1] except for IPv4-unicast and 
        IPv6-unicast being enabled at the peer-group level
    *   No configuration should be made at the global AFI-SAFI level
    
    *   Verification:
        *   For IPv4 neighbor, ensure that the IPv4 neighborship is up and both IPv4-unicast and 
            IPv6-unicast capabilities are negotiated.
        *   For IPv6 neighbor ensure that the IPv6 neighborship is up and both IPv4-unicast and 
            IPv6-unicast capabilities are negotiated.


*   [Test case-1.3] IPv4-unicast and IPv6-Unicast AFI-SAFIs enabled at Global level:
   
    *   Configuration at the neighbor level is same as in [Test case-1] except for IPv4-unicast and 
        IPv6-unicast being enabled at the global level
    *   No configuration should be made at the peer-group AFI-SAFI level
   
    *   Verification:
        *   For IPv4 neighbor, ensure that the IPv4 neighborship is up and both IPv4-unicast and 
            IPv6-unicast capabilities are negotiated.
        *   For IPv6 neighbor ensure that the IPv6 neighborship is up and both IPv4-unicast and 
            IPv6-unicast capabilities are negotiated.

*   [Test case-2] IPv4-unicast and IPv6-Unicast AFI-SAFIs set to FALSE at neighbor level:

    *   AFI-SAFI for IPv4-UNICAST is set to false for BGPv4 peers and AFI-SAFI for IPv6-UNICAST is set to
        false for BGPv6 peers.

    *   Verification:
        *   For IPv4 neighbor, ensure that the IPv4 neighborship is not ESTABLISHED and
            IPv4-unicast capabilities are set to FALSE.
        *   For IPv6 neighbor ensure that the IPv6 neighborship is not ESTABLISHED and
            IPv6-unicast capabilities are set to FALSE.
