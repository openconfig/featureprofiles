# RT-1.14: BGP Long-Lived Graceful Restart

## Summary

BGP Long-Lived Graceful Restart

## Procedure

*   Establish BGP sessions as follows between ATE and DUT
    *   ATE  Port-1  --------  DUT  Port-1. 
    *   DUT  Port-2  --------  ATE  Port-2.
*   Validate received capabilities at DUT and ATE reflect support for graceful restart at the default 
    timer values.
*   For IPv4 and IPv6 routes:
    *   Advertise prefixes from ATE to DUT. 
    *   Trigger DUT session restart by disconnecting TCP session between DUT - ATE Port2 and determine that:
        *   Forwarded traffic between between ATE port-1 and DUT port-1 for the duration of the  
            specified stale routes time (default), during the stale state traffic shouldnt be impacted. 
        *   Dropped after the stale routes timer has expired.
        *   Forwarded again between ATE port-1 and DUT port-1 after the session is re-established. 
    *   Enable Long-Lived Graceful Restart on a per-bgp neighbor basis on DUT. 
        Specify the LLGR timer to be configured to be 600 seconds. Trigger DUT session restart.  
        *   Ensure that the stale prefixes are not withdrawn until the end of the LLGR timer value. 
        *   Ensure that prefixes are withdrawn, and traffic cannot be forwarded between ATE port-1 
            and port-2 after the LLGR timer expiry. 
    *   Induce
        *   Import policy changes 
        *   Export policy changes 
        *   Add 5 more BGP peers 
        *   Remove 5 more BGP peers(block the BGP using filter) 
        *   Routing Process restart 
    *   During above mentioned changes, LLGR shouldn't be impacted and persist during/after the 
        changes.
