 ## TUN-1.6: Tunnel End Point Resize - Interface Based GRE Tunnel

 ## Summary

 *    Tunnel End Point Resize - Interface Based GRE Tunnel

 ## Procedure

 *   Apply the config mentioned in Tunnel-1.1
 *   Send the traffic as mentioned in Tunnel-1.3 and Tunnel-1.4 with TP-1.1 and TP-1.2
 *   Modify the numbers of Tunnel interface being used 
 *   Reduce number of Tunnel interfaces(e.g. From 16 to 12):
         - Incoming traffic on DUT-PORT1 should be load balanced to available Tunnel interfaces for encapsulation
         - Incoming traffic flow should be equally distributed for Encapsulation(ECMP)
 *   If the static routes are used to forward traffic to tunnel, please disable or delete the static route in this test to simulate the reduction in available paths
 *   Increase number of Tunnel interfaces(e.g. From 16 to 20): 
 *   Incoming traffic on DUT-PORT1 should start using additional Tunnel Interfaces  for encapsulation
 *   Incoming traffic flow should be equally distributed for Encapsulation(ECMP)
 *   Increasing and decreasing the number of tunnel interfaces and related static route shouldnâ€™t case traffic drops
 *   Verify the next hop counters for packet being diverted or sent for encapsulation
 *   Verify the tunnel interfaces counters to confirm the traffic encapsulation
 *   Verify the tunnel interfaces traffic/flow for equal distribution for optimal load balancing
 *   After decapsulation, traffic should be load balanced/hash to all available L3 ECMP or LAG or combination of both features
 *   Verify the tunnel interfaces counters to confirm the traffic decapsulation

 *   Validate system for: 
 *   Health-1.1 
 *   No feature related error or drop counters incrementing, 
 *   discussion with vendors required to highlight additional fields to monitor based on implementation and architecture
