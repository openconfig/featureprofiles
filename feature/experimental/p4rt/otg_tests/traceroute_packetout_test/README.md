# P4RT-5.2: Traceroute Packetout

## Summary

Verify that traceroute packets can be sent by the controller.

### Submit to ingress specific behavior

The egress port value must be set to a non empty value but will not be used. The
setting must not be interpreted as the actual egress port id.

## Procedure

*   Connect ATE port-1 to DUT port-1, ATE port-2 to DUT port-2

*   Install a set of routes on the device in both the default and TE VRFs.

*   Enable the P4RT server on the device..

*   Connect a P4RT client and configure the forwarding pipeline.

*   Send IPv4 traceroute packets from the client with varying size.

*   Verify that the packet is received on the ATE on the port corresponding to the routing table in the default VRF.

*   Send an IPv6 traceroute packets from the client with varying size and verify that it is received correctly by the ATE.

*   Repeat for each packet metadata combination shown in the table below.

| egress_port | submit_to_ingress | padding | expected behaviour
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| DUT port-2 | 0x0 | 0x0 | traffic received on ATE port-2
| DUT port-2 | | 0x0 | traffic received on ATE port-2
| DUT port-2 | | | traffic received on ATE port-2
| DUT port-2 | 0x1 | 0x0 | traffic received on ATE port-1
| | 0x1 | | traffic received on ATE port-1
|  | 0x1 | 0x0 | traffic received on ATE port-1
"TBD BY SWITCH" | 0x1 | 0x0 | traffic received on ATE port-1
"TBD BY SWITCH" | 0x1 | | traffic received on ATE port-1
| DUT port-2 | 0x1 | | traffic received on ATE port-1
"TBD BY SWITCH" | 0x0 | 0x0 | no traffic received
"TBD BY SWITCH" | 0x0 | | no traffic received
"TBD BY SWITCH" | | 0x0 | no traffic received
| "TBD BY SWITCH" | | | no traffic received
|  | 0x0 | 0x0 | no traffic received
| | 0x0 | | no traffic received
| | | 0x0 | no traffic received
| | | | no traffic received

*   Validate:

    *   Traffic received over the appropriate ATE port.
