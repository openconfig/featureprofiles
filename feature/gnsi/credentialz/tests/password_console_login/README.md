# Credentialz-1: Password console login

## Summary

Test that Credentialz properly creates users and the associated password and that the DUT handles
authentication of those users properly.

## Testbed type
* [`featureprofiles/topologies/dut.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/dut.testbed)

## Canonical OC
```json
{
  "system": {
    "aaa": {
      "authentication": {
        "users": {
          "user": [
            {
              "config": {
                "password": "xxxxxxx",
                "ssh-key": "yyyyyyy",
                "username": "testuser"
              },
              "username": "testuser"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Procedure

* Set a username of `testuser` with a password having following restrictions:
  * Must be 24-32 characters long.
  * Must use 4 of the 5 character classes ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], [!@#$%^&*(){}[]\|:;'"], [ ]).
* Perform the following tests and assert the expected result:
  * Case 1: Success
    * Authenticate with the `testuser` username and password created in the first step above.
    * Authentication must result in success with a prompt.
  * Case 2: Failure
    * Authenticate with the `testuser` username and an *incorrect* password of `password`
    * Assert that authentication has failed
  * Case 3: Failure
    * Authenticate with the invalid  username `username` and a valid (for a different username)
      password created in the first step above.
    * Assert that authentication has failed
