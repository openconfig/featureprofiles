# RT-5.7: Aggregate Not Viable All
[TODO: test automation/coding; issue https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/1655]
## Summary

Test forwarding-viable with LAG and routing

Ensure that when --all LAG member-- become set with forwarding-viable == FALSE

-   forwarding-viable=false impact --only-- transmit traffic on all member port
-   All member ports set with forwarding-viable=false can receive all type of traffic \
    and forward it normally (same as with forwarding-viable=true)
-   ISIS adjacency is established on LAG port w/ all member set to forwarding-viable \
    == FALSE
-   Traffic that normally egress LAG with all members set to forwarding-viable == FALSE \
    is forwarded by the next best egress interface/LAG.
