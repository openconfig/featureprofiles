# SR-1.2: Egress Node Forwarding

## Summary

This is to test the forwarding functionality of MPLS traffic on an Egress node 
in SRTE+MPLS enabled network.

The tests validate that the DUT performs the following actions -

 - DUT is an egress node in SRTE+MPLS network.
 - DUT will receive unlabled traffic for IPv4 destination and perform IPv4 forwarding.
 - DUT wil receive MPLS Label 2 traffic for IPv6 destinations.
 - DUT will pop the MPLS label 2 and perform IPv6 forwarding.


## Testbed type

* [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_2.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed)

## Procedure

### Test environment setup

* Create the following connections:
* DUT has ingress and egress port connected to the ATE.
  
```mermaid
graph LR; 
A[ATE:Port1] --Ingress--> B[Port1:DUT:Port2];B --Egress--> C[Port2:ATE];
```

* ATE Port 1 hosted prefixes:
  
  * ATE-Port1 IPV4 address = ATE-P1-Address
  * Additional Source Address = IPV4-SRC1
  * Additional Source Address = IPV6-SRC1

* ATE Port 2 hosted prefixes:
  
  * ATE-Port2 IPV4 address = ATE-P2-Address
  * Additional destination address = IPV4-DST1
  * Additional destination address = IPV6-DST1

*  ATE Port 1 generates below flow types:
 
 * Flow type 1:  Ethernet+IPv4+Payload
  * For the Ethernet Header:
     * Source MAC address: Unicast Ethernet MAC
     * Destination MAC address: DUT-Port1 mac address
   * For the IP header:
     * Source IP and Destination IP will be IPV4-SRC1 and IPV4-DST1 respectively.
     * Protocol can be TCP/UDP and source and destination port will vary.

 * Flow type 2:  Ethernet+MPLS+IPv6+Payload
  * For the Ethernet Header:
     * Source MAC address: Unicast Ethernet MAC
     * Destination MAC address: DUT-Port1 mac address
  * For MPLS header:
     * MPLS label 2
     * EXP set to 0
     * S set to 1
     * TTL set to 64  
  * For the IPv6 header:
     * Source IP and Destination IP will be IPV6-SRC1 and IPV6-DST1 respectively.
     * Protocol can be TCP/UDP and source and destination port will vary.
## Procedure

### Configuration
                              
*   Configure Segment Routing Global Block (srgb) lower-bound: 400000 upper-bound: 465001)
*   Enable Segment Routing for the ISIS
*   Enable MPLS forwarding.
*   DUT will have a static IPv4 and IPv6 route for IPV4-DST1 / IPV6-DST1 towards ATE Port2.

### Test 

Verify that:

*  ATE Port1 will send IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
*  DUT will perform IPv4 lookup for the destination and forward IPv4 traffic.
*  DUT will POP MPLS label, and perform IPv6 lookup for the destination and forward IPv6 traffic.
