# SYS-1.1: Test default COPP policy thresholds for Arista

## Summary

***NOTE:*** This test is a CLI test until necessary YANG/OC is developed and it is applicable to Arista `7280DR3AK-36` only

*   Ensure that the default CoPP protects the control plane from excessive traffic and prioritizes critical control plane packets
*   Verify that the default CoPP queues function correctly and handle packet drops as expected
*   Default policy thresholds have been verified using CLI: `show policy-map type copp copp-system-policy` on `7280DR3AK-36`

## Procedure

### Initial setup

*   Connect DUT port-1, 2 to ATE port-1, 2 respectively
*   Configure IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on DUT and ATE ports as shown below

    *   DUT port-1 IPv4 address ```dp1-v4 = 192.168.1.1/30```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv4 address ```ap1-v4 = 192.168.1.2/30```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv4 address ```dp2-v4 = 192.168.1.5/30```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv4 address ```ap2-v4 = 192.168.1.6/30```

    *   DUT port-1 IPv6 address ```dp1-v6 = 2001:DB8::1/126```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv6 address ```ap1-v6 = 2001:DB8::2/126```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv6 address ```dp2-v6 = 2001:DB8::5/126```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv6 address ```ap2-v6 = 2001:DB8::6/126```
