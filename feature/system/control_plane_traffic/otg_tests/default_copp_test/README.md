# SYS-1.1: Test default COPP policy thresholds for Arista

## Summary

***NOTE:*** \

We will not configure any CoPP policies or thresholds on the DUT. We will solely rely on the vendor default and pre-applied CoPP policies and thresholds \
[TODO] Utilize standardized OC models as they become available

*   Ensure that the default CoPP protects the control plane from excessive traffic and prioritizes critical control plane packets
*   Verify that the default CoPP queues function correctly and handle packet drops as expected

## Procedure

### Initial setup

*   Connect DUT port-1, 2 to ATE port-1, 2 respectively

    *   DUT port-1 IPv4 address ```dp1-v4 = 192.168.1.1/30```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv4 address ```ap1-v4 = 192.168.1.2/30```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv4 address ```dp2-v4 = 192.168.1.5/30```
    *   ATE port-2 IPv4 address ```ap2-v4 = 192.168.1.6/30```

    *   DUT port-1 IPv6 address ```dp1-v6 = 2001:DB8::1/126```
    *   ATE port-1 IPv6 address ```ap1-v6 = 2001:DB8::2/126```

    *   DUT port-2 IPv6 address ```dp2-v6 = 2001:DB8::5/126```

## Canonical OC

***NOTE:*** When the goal evolves to testing configurable CoPP, this section would ideally contain the (future) standardized OC CoPP config model

```json
