# TE-3.7: Base Hierarchical NHG Update

## Summary

Validate NHG update in hierarchical resolution scenario

## Procedure

*   Connect ATE port-1 to DUT port-1, ATE port-2 to DUT port-2, ATE port-3 to
    DUT port-3.
*   Create a non-default VRF (VRF-1) that includes DUT port-1.
*   Establish gRIBI client connection with DUT and make it become leader.
*   Use Modify RPC to install entries per the following order, and ensure FIB
    ACK is received for each of the AFTOperation:
    *   Add 203.0.113.1/32 (default VRF) to NextHopGroup (NHG#42 in default VRF)
        containing one NextHop (NH#40 in default VRF) that specifies DUT port-2
        as the egress interface and 00:1A:11:00:1A:BC as the destination MAC
        address.
    *   Add 198.51.100.0/24 (VRF-1) to NextHopGroup (NHG#44 in default VRF)
        containing one NextHop (NH#43 in default VRF) specified to be
        203.0.113.1/32 in the default VRF.
*   Ensure that ATE port-2 receives the packets with 00:1A:11:00:1A:BC as the
    destination MAC address.
*   Use the Modify RPC with ADD operation to test NHG implicit in-place replace
    (step by step as below):
    1.  Add a new NH (NH#41) with egress interface that specifies DUT port-3 as
        the egress interface and 00:1A:11:00:1A:BC as the destination MAC
        address.
    2.  Add the same NHG#42 but reference both NH#40 and NH#41.
    3.  Validate that both ATE port-2 and ATE port-3 receives the packets with
        00:1A:11:00:1A:BC as the destination MAC address.
    4.  Add the same NHG#42 but reference only NH#41.
    5.  Validate that only ATE port-3 receives the packets.
    6.  Add the same NHG#42 but reference only NH#40.
    7.  Validate that only ATE port-2 receives the packets

Repeat the above tests with one additional scenario with the following changes,
and it should not change the expected test result.

*   Add an empty decap VRF, `DECAP_TE_VRF`.
*   Add 4 empty encap VRFs, `ENCAP_TE_VRF_A`, `ENCAP_TE_VRF_B`, `ENCAP_TE_VRF_C`
    and `ENCAP_TE_VRF_D`.
*   Replace the existing VRF selection policy with `vrf_selection_policy_w` as
    in <https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/pull/2217>

## Minimum DUT platform requirement

vRX if the vendor implementation supports FIB-ACK simulation, otherwise FFF.

# TE-3.7: Drain Implementation Test.

## Summary

Validate NHG update in Drain Implementation Test.

## Procedure

*   Steps:
*   Topology
    *   [ATE port-1] — [port-1 DUT port-2] — [port-2 ATE] Port-3]—-[port-3 ATE]
        Port-4]—-[port-4 ATE]
*   DUT port-2, port-3 and port-4 are each making a one-member trunk port
    (trunk-2 and trunk-3, trunk-4).
*   Configure a destination network-a connected to trunk-2, trunk-3 and trunk-4.
*   gRIBI installs the following routing structure (700 IPv4 prefix, NHG and NH
    numbers stays the same as the illustration), and expect FIB ACKs:
*   In the DEFAULT VRF: VIP1 -> NHG#1 -> [NH#1 {mac: MagicMAC, interface:
    DUTPort2Trunk}, NH#2 {mac: MagicMAC, interface: DUTPort3Trunk}] NHG#10 ->
    NH#10 {decap, network-instance: DEFAULT VRF} NHG#20 -> [ NH#20{ip: VIP1},
    backupNH: NHG#10]

*   In a non-defualt VRF, VRF-1: IPv4Entries(1000 /32 IPv4 entries) -> NHG#20

*   Send 10K IPinIP traffic flows from ATE port-1 to network-a.

*   Validate that traffic is going via trunk-2 and trunk-3 and there is no
    traffic loss.

*   Send one gRIBI NHG#1 update to replace NH#1 and NH#2 with NH#3 pointing to
    trunk#4.

*   Expect FIB ACKs, and validate that all traffic are moved to trunk#4 with no
    traffic loss.

*   Send one gRIBI NHG#1 update to revert back the changes above.

*   Expect FIB ACKs and validate that the traffic is moved back to trunk-2 and
    trunk-3 with less than <xx> ms traffic loss.
