# TE-6.1: Route Removal via Flush

## Summary

Validate that Flush RPC in gRIBI removes routes in the default VRF as expected.

## Procedure

*   Connect ATE port-1 to DUT port-1, and ATE port-2 to DUT port-2.
*   Connect gRIBI client (gRIBI-A) with `election_id=10` to DUT, with
    persistence set to PRESERVE and SINGLE_PRIMARY redundancy specified. Connect
    a second client (gRIBI-B) using the same parameters, but with
    `election_id=9` .
*   Inject an entry into the default network instance pointing to ATE port-2.
    *   Ensure that traffic can be forwarded between ATE port-1 and ATE port-2
        for destinations in 198.51.100.0/24.
    *   Issue Flush RPC from gRIBI-A, and ensure that packets can no longer be
        forwarded for destinations in 192.0.2.0/2. Ensure that AFT telemetry
        reflects the entry being removed.
    *   Re-inject entry for 198.51.100.0/24 from gRIBI-A.
    *   Issue Flush RPC from gRIBI-B. Ensure that entries are not removed via
        packet forwarding and AFT telemetry; expect a NOT_PRIMARY RPC response
        error.
    *   Increase `gRIBI-B`â€™s `election_id` to 11 by sending a `ModifyRequest`
        with `election_id=11`.
    *   Issue Flush from gRIBI-B, ensure that entries are removed via packet
        forwarding and telemetry.
