# TE-2.1: gRIBI IPv4 Entry

## Summary

Validate IPv4 support in gRIBI.

## Procedure

*   Connect ATE port-1 to DUT port-1, ATE port-2 to DUT port-2, and ATE port-3
    to DUT port-3.
*   Establish gRIBI client connection with DUT, negotiating `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK` as
    the requested `ack_type` and persistence mode `PRESERVE`. make it become
    leader. Flush all entries after each case.
*   Using gRIBI Modify RPC install the following IPv4Entry sets, and validate
    the specified behaviours:
    *   Single IPv4Entry -> NHG -> NH.
        *   Install 198.51.100.0/24 to NextHopGroup containing one NextHop
            specified to ATE port-2.
        *   Forward packets between ATE port-1 and ATE port-2 (destined to
            198.51.100.0/24 ) and determine that packets are forwarded
            successfully:
    *   Single IPv4Entry -> NHG -> multiple NHs.
        *   Install 198.51.100.0/24 to NextHopGroup containing two NextHop
            entries specified to ATE ports 2 and 3.
        *   Validate that packets forwarded between ATE ports 1 and (2 and 3),
            ensuring that traffic is forwarded.
    *   Single IPv4Entry -> NHG -> multiple NHs with MAC override.
        *   Install 198.51.100.0/24 to NextHopGroup containing two NextHop
            entries specified to ATE ports 2 and 3, and override the
            destination MAC to a specified value.
        *   Validate that packets forwarded between ATE ports 1 and (2 and 3)
        *   TODO: validate the ATE received packets are of the expected
            destination MAC address.
    *   Single IPv4Entry -> NHG -> non-existent NH.
        *   Send a Modify() containing 2 AFTOperations that install
            198.51.100.0/24 to NextHopGroup containing next-hops that do not
            exist. Validate that FAILED error is received for all the 2
            operations. Ensure that traffic to 198.51.100.0/24 is blackholed.
    *   Single IPv4Entry -> NHG -> NH with down interface
        *   Install 198.51.100.0/24 to NextHopGroup containing a NextHop that
            references (interface_ref) a down interface and override the
            destination MAC (mac_address), ensure that `FIB_PROGRAMMED` is
            returned.

If the device supports it, repeat this test with gRIBI client persistence mode
`DELETE` without flushing entries between cases.
