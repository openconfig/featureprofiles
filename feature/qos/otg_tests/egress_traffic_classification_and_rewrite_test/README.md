# DP-1.17: Egress traffic DSCP rewrite
## Summary

This test validates egress traffic scheduling and packet remarking (rewrite) on a DUT. IP payload encapsulated as IPoGRE,
IPoMPLSoGRE,IPoGUE or IPoMPLSoGUE would be decapsulated by DUT as per tunnel termination configuration and forwarded as an 
IP payload via the egress interface. IP payload should be scheduled via egress interface according to DSCP markings prior to rewrite.
DSCP values of IP payload encapsulated as IPoGRE, IPoMPLSoGRE, IPoGUE or IPoMPLSoGUE should have payload DSCP values re-written 
per egress QOS re-write policy applied to the egress interface. Egress QOS policy should support match conditions on payload 
IP header fields, specifically DSCP values. Based on the match condition, DSCP must be set to a new value. DUT configuration 
will be evaluated against OpenConfig QOS model, and traffic flows analyzed to ensure proper scheduling, re-marking, and forwarding.

1. DUT:Port1 is a Singleton IP interface towards ATE:Port1.
2. DUT:Port2 is a Singleton IP interface towards ATE:Port2.
3. DUT has egress forwarding  entry in it's FIB via ATE:Port1  towards  ATE:Port2: BGP routing could be used to populate FIB as follows:
   3a. DUT forms one IPv4 and one IPV6 eBGP session with ATE:Port1 using connected Singleton interface IPs.
   3b. DUT forms one IPv4 and one IPV6 eBGP session with ATE:Port2 using connected Singleton interface IPs.
   3c. DUT has IPv4-DST-DECAP/32 and IPv6-DST-DECAP/128 advertised to ATE:Port1 via IPv4 BGP. This IP is used for decapsulation.
7.    ATE:Port2 advertises destination networks IPv4-DST-NET/32 and IPv6-DST-NET/128 to DUT.
8. DUT decapsulates IPoGRE, IPoMPLSoGRE,IPoGUE or IPoMPLSoGUE payload with destination of IPv4-DST-DECAP/32 and IPv6-DST-DECAP/128
9. DUT has MPLS static forwarding rule (aka static LSP) for label 100020 pointing to a NHG resolved via ATE:Port2.
10. DUT matches packets on DSCP/TC values and sets new DSCP values based on remarking rules.
