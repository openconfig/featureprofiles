# DP-2.6 Police traffic on input matching all packets using 2 rate, 3 color marker with classifier

## Summary

Use IP address and mac-address from topology shared below. Static Routes can be used for this.
Configure an ingress scheduler to police traffic using a 2 rate, 3 color policer and attach the scheduler to the interface with classifier.
Lack of match conditions will cause all packets to be matched. 
Send traffic to validate the policer.

## Topology

* [`featureprofiles/topologies/atedut_2.testbed`](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/topologies/atedut_2.testbed)

## Test setup

```mermaid
graph LR;
ATE[ATE] <-- (Port 1) --> DUT[DUT] <-- (Port 2) --> ATE[ATE];
```

## Procedure

### Testbed setup - Generate configuration for ATE and DUT

#### Source & Destination Port for traffic

* ATE (Port1) --- IP Connectivity --- DUT (Dut1),  DUT (Dut2) --- IP Connectivity --- ATE (Port2)
* Use below to configure traffic with following source and destination.

  * Dut1 = Attributes {
		Desc:    "Dut1",
		MAC:     "02:01:00:00:00:01",
		IPv4:    "200.0.0.1/24",
		IPv6:    "2001:f:d:e::1/126",
	}
  * atePort1 = Attributes{
		Desc:    "atePort1",
		MAC:     "02:01:00:00:00:02",
		IPv4:    "200.0.0.2/24",
		IPv6:    "2001:f:d:e::2/126",
	}
  * Dut2 = Attributes{
		Desc:    "Dut2",
		MAC:     "02:00:01:01:01:01",
		IPv4:    "100.0.0.1/24",
		IPv6:    "2001:c:d:e::1/126",
	}
  * atePort2 = Attributes{
		Desc:    "atePort2",
		MAC:     "02:00:01:01:01:02",
		IPv4:    "100.0.0.2/24",
		IPv6:    "2001:c:d:e::2/126",
	}

* Create static route from atePort1 to atePort2.

### SetUp

* Generate config for scheduler polices with an input rate 2Gbps limit and a classifier.
* Apply them to DUT interface . Dut1 is LAG in provided setup.
* Use gnmi.Replace to push the config to the DUT.

### DP-2.6.1 Test traffic

* Send traffic
  * Send flow traffic from atePort1 to DUT towards atePort2 at 1.5Gbps (note cir is 1Gbps & pir is 2Gbps).
  * Validate qos counters on dut1 of DUT .
    * Validate DUT qos interface scheduler counters count packets as conforming-pkts, conforming-octets, exceeding-pkts & exceeding-octets.
  * Validate packets are received by atePort2.
    * Validate at OTG that 0 packets are lost on flow.
  * Increase traffic on flow to atePort2 to 4Gbps
    * Validate that flow to atePort2 experiences ~50% packet loss (+/- 1%)
    * Validate packet loss count as violating-pkts & violating-octets.
