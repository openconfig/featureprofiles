# Instructions for this template

Below is the required template for writing test requirements.  Good examples of test
requirements include:

* [TE-3.7: Base Hierarchical NHG Update](/feature/gribi/otg_tests/base_hierarchical_nhg_update/README.md)
* [gNMI-1.13: Telemetry: Optics Power and Bias Current](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/feature/platform/tests/optics_power_and_bias_current_test/README.md)
* [RT-5.1: Singleton Interface](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/feature/interface/singleton/otg_tests/singleton_test/README.md)

# TestID-x.y: Short name of test here

## Summary

Write a few sentences or paragraphs describing the purpose and scope of the test.

## Testbed type

* Specify the .testbed topology file from the [topologies](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/tree/main/topologies) folder to be used with this test

## Procedure

* Test environment setup
  * Description of procedure to configure ATE and DUT with pre-requisites making it possible to cover the intended paths and RPC's.

* TestID-x.y.z - Name of subtest
  * Step 1
  * Step 2
  * Validation and pass/fail criteria

* TestID-x.y.z - Name of subtest
  * Step 1
  * Step 2
  * Validation and pass/fail criteria
