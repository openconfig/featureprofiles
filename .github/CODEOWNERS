# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @openconfig/featureprofiles-maintainers will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @openconfig/featureprofiles-maintainers @openconfig/featureprofiles-quattro-tl

# reviewers for tests which are ported from ate-tests to 
# otg-tests may be reviewed by this team
**/otg-tests/**    @openconfig/featureprofiles-maintainers-otg

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.
