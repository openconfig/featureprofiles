# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @openconfig/featureprofiles-maintainers will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Tests which are ported from ate_tests to otg_tests may be reviewed by this team.
