# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @openconfig/featureprofiles-maintainers will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @openconfig/featureprofiles-maintainers

# /feature folders each have owners who are auto requested for review and may merge PR's
