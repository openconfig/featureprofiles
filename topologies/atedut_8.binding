# proto-message: openconfig.testing.Binding

# This is an example static binding that demonstrates how to specify
# options to be used in conjunction with the atedut_*.testbed
# testbeds.

# These options are inherited throughout the entire binding for both the
# DUT and the ATE, unless overridden by a specific device or protocol.
options {
  username: "username"
  password: "password"
}

  id: "dut"
  name: "dut-hostname"  # Change this to the device hostname.

  # Options inherited by all protocols on this device unless
  # overridden by individual protocols.  Remove if not needed.
  options {
    insecure: true
  }

  # Options specific to gNMI.  Remove if not needed.
  gnmi {
    target: "dut-proxy-hostname:6030"
  }

  # Options specific to gNOI
  gnoi {

  # Before this binding can be used with a topology, add ports mapping
  # from its topology ID to the actual port name on the device.

    id: "port1"
