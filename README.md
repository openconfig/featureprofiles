# Feature Profiles

Feature profiles defines groups of OpenConfig paths that can be invoked on
network devices. A feature profile may contain configuration, telemetry,
operational or any other paths that a device exposes. Example management plane
device APIs are gNMI, and gNOI. Example control plane APIs are gRIBI, and
protocols such as BGP, IS-IS.

Feature profiles also includes a suite of
[Ondatra](https://github.com/openconfig/ondatra) tests for validating the
network device behavior for each defined feature. If you are new to Ondatra,
please start by reading the Ondata
[README](https://github.com/openconfig/ondatra#readme) and taking the [Ondatra
tour](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openconfig/ondatra/main/internal/tour/tour.pdf).

# Running Tests on Virtual Devices

Tests may be run on virtual devices using the
[Kubernetes Network Emulation](https://github.com/openconfig/kne) binding.

First, follow the
[steps for deploying a KNE cluster](https://github.com/openconfig/kne/blob/main/docs/create_topology.md#deploy-a-cluster).
Then follow the per-vendor instructions below for creating a KNE topology and
running a test on it.

## Arista

### cEOS

[Arista cEOS](https://www.arista.com/en/products/software-controlled-container-networking)
images can be obtained by contacting Arista.

1. Create the topology:

```
kne create topologies/kne/arista/ceos/topology.textproto
```

2. Run a sample test:

```
go test ./feature/example/tests/... -kne-topo $PWD/topologies/kne/arista/ceos/topology.textproto -vendor_creds ARISTA/admin/admin
```

3. Cleanup:

```
kne delete topologies/kne/arista/ceos/topology.textproto
```

# Running Tests on Real Hardware

Tests may be run on real hardware devices using the static binding.

The static binding supports the testbeds in the `topologies/*.testbed` files.
The mapping between the IDs in the testbed file and the physical devices are
provided by the corresponding `topologies/*.binding` files. To try it out, edit
`otgdut_4.binding` to specify the mapping from testbed IDs to actual hardware
devices, as well as the desired protocol dial options. Then test it by running:

```
go test ./feature/example/tests/topology_test -binding $PWD/topologies/otgdut_4.binding
```

# Path validation

The `make validate_paths` target will clone the public OpenConfig definitions
and report Feature Profiles that have invalid OpenConfig paths.
