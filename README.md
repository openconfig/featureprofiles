# Feature Profiles

Feature profiles define groups of OpenConfig paths that can be invoked on network 
devices.  A feature profile may contain configuration, telemetry, operational or 
any other paths that a device exposes.  Example management plane device APIs are 
gNMI, and gNOI.  Example control plane APIs are gRIBI, and protocols such as BGP, 
IS-IS.

Feature profiles also include a suite of tests for validating the network device
behavior for each defined feature.

Feedback and suggestions to improve OpenConfig Feature Profiles is welcomed on the
[public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/netopenconfig),
or by opening a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues).


# Examples
Tests below are implemented using the [ONDATRA](https://github.com/openconfig/ondatra)
test framework with the [Kubernetes Network Emulation](https://github.com/openconfig/kne) 
binding.

### Arista cEOS
[Arista cEOS](https://www.arista.com/en/products/software-controlled-container-networking) images can be obtained by contacting Arista.

Setup
```
kne_cli create topologies/kne/arista_ceos.textproto
cat >topologies/kne/testbed.kne.yml << EOF
username: admin
password: admin
topology: $PWD/topologies/kne/arista_ceos.textproto
cli: $HOME/go/bin/kne_cli
EOF
```
Testing
```
go test -v feature/system/tests/*.go -kne-config $PWD/topologies/kne/testbed.kne.yml -testbed $PWD/topologies/dut.testbed
```

Cleanup
```
kne_cli delete topologies/kne/arista_ceos.textproto
```

### Nokia SR-Linux
SR Linux images can be found [here](https://github.com/nokia/srlinux-container-image/pkgs/container/srlinux) and will require the [SRL Controller](https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-controller) to be installed on the KNE Kubernetes cluster.

Setup
```
kne_cli create topologies/kne/nokia_srl.textproto
cat >topologies/kne/testbed.kne.yml << EOF
username: admin
password: admin
topology: $PWD/topologies/kne/nokia_srl.textproto
cli: $HOME/go/bin/kne_cli
EOF
```

Testing
```
go test -v feature/system/tests/*.go -kne-config $PWD/topologies/kne/testbed.kne.yml -testbed $PWD/topologies/dut.testbed
```

Cleanup
```
kne_cli delete topologies/kne/nokia_srl.textproto
```

### Static Binding (Experimental)

The static binding supports ATE based testing with a real hardware device. It
assumes that there is one ATE hooked up to one DUT in the testbed, and their
ports are connected pairwise. They are defined in `topologies/atedut_*.testbed`
with three variants: 2 ports, 4 ports, and 12 ports.

*   The 2 port variant is able to run the vast majority of the control plane
    tests.
*   The 4 port variant is required by some VRF based or data plane tests.
*   The 12 port variant is required by the aggregate interface (static LAG and
    LACP) tests.

Setup: edit `topologies/atedut_12.binding` to specify the mapping from testbed
topology to the actual hardware as well as the dial options.

Testing:

```
cd ./topologies/topology_test
go test -v . -testbed ../atedut_12.testbed -binding ../atedut_12.binding
```

> :exclamation: **NOTE**: when `go test` runs a test, the current working
> directory is set to the path of the test package, so the testbed and binding
> files are relative to the test package and not to the source root. It is
> recommended to just `cd` to the test package to be consistent.

> :warning: **WARNING**: the topology\_test is derived from a similar test used
> at Google. The test code compiles but is not tested because we have not hooked
> up Google's testing environment to the open-sourced static binding. This is an
> early preview meant to demonstrate Ondatra API usage.

## Path validation

The `make validate_paths` target will clone the public OpenConfig definitions and report Feature Profiles that have invalid OpenConfig paths.
