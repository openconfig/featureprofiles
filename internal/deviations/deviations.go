// Package deviations defines the arguments to enable temporary workarounds
// for the featureprofiles test suite.
//
// Deviations may be introduced to temporarily work around non-compliant issues
// so further sub-tests can be implemented.  Deviations should be
// small in scope, typically affecting one sub-test, one OpenConfig
// path or small OpenConfig sub-tree.  Deviations are enabled using
// command line parameters.
//
// Passing with a deviation enabled is considered non-compliant to the
// OpenConfig featureprofiles test.
//
// To add a deviation:
//   - Submit a github issue explaining the need for the deviation.
//   - Submit a pull request referencing the above issue to add a flag to
//     this file and updates to the tests where it is intended to be used.
//
// To remove a deviation:
//   - Submit a pull request which proposes to resolve the relevant
//     github issue by removing the deviation and it's usage within tests.
//   - Typically the author or an affiliate of the author's organization
//     is expected to remove a deviation they introduced.
//
// To enable the deviations for a test run:
//   - By default, deviations are not enabled and instead require the
//     test invocation to set an argument to enable the deviation.
//   - For example:
//     go test my_test.go --deviation_interface_enabled=true
