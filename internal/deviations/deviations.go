// Package deviations defines the arguments to enable temporary workarounds for the
// featureprofiles test suite using command line flags.
//
// If we consider device compliance level in tiers:
//
//   - Tier 0: Full OpenConfig compliance.  The device can do everything specified by
//     OpenConfig.
//   - Tier 1: Test plan compliance.  The device can pass a test without deviation, which
//     means it satisfies the test requirements.  This is the target compliance tier for
//     featureprofiles tests.
//   - Tier 2: Deviated test plan compliance.  The device can pass a test with deviation.
//
// Deviations typically work by reducing testing requirements or by changing the way the
// configuration is done.  However, the targeted compliance tier is always without
// deviation.
//
// Requirements for deviations:
//
//   - Deviations may only use OpenConfig compliant behavior.
//   - Deviations should be small in scope, typically affecting one sub-test, one
//     OpenConfig path or small OpenConfig sub-tree.
//
// If a device could not pass without deviation, that is considered non-compliant
// behavior.  Ideally, a device should pass both with and without a deviation which means
// the deviation could be safely removed.  However, when the OpenConfig model allows the
// device to reject the deviated case even if it is compliant, then this should be
// explained on a case-by-case basis.
//
// To add a deviation:
//
//   - Submit a github issue explaining the need for the deviation.
//   - Submit a pull request referencing the above issue to add a flag to
//     this file and updates to the tests where it is intended to be used.
//   - Make sure the deviation defaults to false.  False (not deviated) means strictly
//     compliant behavior.  True (deviated) activates the workaround.
//
// To remove a deviation:
//
//   - Submit a pull request which proposes to resolve the relevant
//     github issue by removing the deviation and it's usage within tests.
//   - Typically the author or an affiliate of the author's organization
//     is expected to remove a deviation they introduced.
//
// To enable the deviations for a test run:
//
//   - By default, deviations are not enabled and instead require the
//     test invocation to set an argument to enable the deviation.
//   - For example:
//     go test my_test.go --deviation_interface_enabled=true
