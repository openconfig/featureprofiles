# cfgplugins package

## Goal

The [contributing
guide](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
specifies that `cfgplugins` should be used for DUT configuration generation.  

The goal of the featureprofiles `cfgplugins` is to provide a library of
functions that generate reusable configuration snippets. These in turn are used
to compose configurations used in featureprofiles tests.  

## Implementing cfgplugins

The cfgplugins structure should align with the /feature folder, which in turn
is roughly aligned with the OpenConfig data model tree.  Top level feature
folders should have a cfgplugins file using the same name.  

Each function in `cfgplugins` should define a struct to hold the required
attributes, which is then passed to the configuration generation function. The
code in the function should construct and return an ondatra `gnmi.BatchReplace`
object. Here is an
[example](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/bc105a443b44d862c70e91112708b5a339c71ae5/internal/cfgplugins/sflow.go#L52))

Test code (`_test.go` files) should call as many `cfgplugins` as needed to
compose the desired configuration.  After assembling the configuration needed
for a particular test or subtest, the test should call `batch.Set()` to replace
the portion of the configuration on the DUT described by in the batch object.
Here is a simple
[example](https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/blob/main/feature/sflow/otg_tests/sflow_base_test/sflow_base_test.go#L212-L215).

The idea behind placing the `.Set` call in the test code is this is modifying
the DUT and is what is being tested.  In other words, we are not testing the
configuration generation helper, but rather we are testing if the DUT will
accept the configuration.

## Deviations and cfgplugins

Deviations affecting configuration generation must be placed into the relevant
`cfgplugins` functions.  This way the deviation is used consistently across all
tests, is easier to discover and maintain compared to the deviations being
defined in individual tests.  For example, if one wants to configure a static
MPLS LSP, one can search the cfgplugins to find a suitable function and all
relevant deviation(s) in one place.
